Yes the wording is wrong here, more like "host OSes only assign devices
whose accesses are coherent". And it's not guaranteed, just I'm still
looking for a realistic counter-example. I guess a good indicator would be
a VMM that presents a device without 'dma-coherent'.

Ah, I was hoping that vfio-pci should only be concerned about no-snoop. Do
you know if your series [2] ensures that the SMMU driver doesn't report
IOMMU_CAP_CACHE_COHERENCY for that system?

Ah duh, I missed that PCI_EXP_DEVCTL_NOSNOOP_EN defaults to 1, of course
it does. So I think VFIO should clear it on Arm and make it read-only,
since the SMMU can't force-snoop like on x86. I'd be tempted to do that if
CONFIG_ARM{,64} is enabled, but checking a new IOMMU capability may be
cleaner.

Thanks,
Jean
