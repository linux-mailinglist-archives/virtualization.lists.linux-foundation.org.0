As written in our private conversation, a mapping of the ivshmem2 device 
discovery to platform mechanism (device tree etc.) and maybe even the 
register access for doorbell and life-cycle management to something 
hypercall-like would be imaginable. What would count more from virtio 
perspective is a common mapping on a shared memory transport.

That said, I also warned about all the features that PCI already defined 
(such as message-based interrupts) which you may have to add when going 
a different way for the shared memory device.
