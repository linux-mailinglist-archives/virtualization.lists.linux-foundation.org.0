Introduce a paravirtualization interface for KVM/arm64 to obtain the vCPU
that is currently running or not.

The PV lock structure of the guest is allocated by user space.

A hypercall interface is provided for the guest to interrogate the
hypervisor's support for this interface and the location of the shared
memory structures.

+Paravirtualized lock support for arm64
+======================================
+
+KVM/arm64 provides some hypervisor service calls to support a paravirtualized
+guest obtaining whether the vCPU is currently running or not.
+
+Two new SMCCC compatible hypercalls are defined:
+* ARM_SMCCC_VENDOR_HYP_KVM_PV_LOCK_FUNC_ID:  0x86000001
+  - KVM_PV_LOCK_FEATURES   0
+  - KVM_PV_LOCK_PREEMPTED  1
+
+The existence of the PV_LOCK hypercall should be probed using the SMCCC 1.1
+ARCH_FEATURES mechanism and the hypervisor should be KVM before calling it.
+
+KVM_PV_LOCK_FEATURES
+    ============= ========    ==========
+    Function ID:  (uint32)    0x86000001
+    PV_call_id:   (uint32)    0
+    Return value: (int64)     NOT_SUPPORTED (-1) or SUCCESS (0) if the relevant
+                              PV-lock feature is supported by the hypervisor.
+    ============= ========    ==========
+
+KVM_PV_LOCK_PREEMPTED
+    ============= ========    ==========
+    Function ID:  (uint32)    0x86000001
+    PV_call_id:   (uint32)    1
+    Return value: (int64)     IPA of the PV-lock data structure for this vCPU.
+                              On failure:
+                              NOT_SUPPORTED (-1)
+    ============= ========    ==========
+
+The IPA returned by KVM_PV_LOCK_PREEMPTED should be mapped by the guest as
+normal memory with inner and outer write back caching attributes, in the inner
+shareable domain.
+
+KVM_PV_LOCK_PREEMPTED returns the structure for the calling vCPU.
+
+PV lock state
+-------------
+
+The structure pointed to by the KVM_PV_LOCK_PREEMPTED hypercall is as follows:
+
++-----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------------------+
+| Field     | Byte Length | Byte Offset | Description                       |
++===========+=============+=============+===================================+
+| preempted |      8      |      0      | Indicates that the vCPU that owns |
+|           |             |             | this struct is running or not.    |
+|           |             |             | Non-zero values mean the vCPU has |
+|           |             |             | been preempted. Zero means the    |
+|           |             |             | vCPU is not preempted.            |
++-----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------------------+
+
+The preempted field will be updated to 1 by the hypervisor prior to scheduling
+a vCPU. When the vCPU is scheduled out, the preempted field will be updated
+to 0 by the hypervisor.
+
+The structure will be present within a reserved region of the normal memory
+given to the guest. The guest should not attempt to write into this memory.
+There is a structure per vCPU of the guest.
+
+It is advisable that one or more 64k pages are set aside for the purpose of
+these structures and not used for other purposes, this enables the guest to map
+the region using 64k pages and avoids conflicting attributes with other memory.
+
+For the user space interface see Documentation/virt/kvm/devices/vcpu.txt
+section "4. GROUP: KVM_ARM_VCPU_PVLOCK_CTRL".
