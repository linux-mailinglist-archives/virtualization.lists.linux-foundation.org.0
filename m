QEMU's virtio-blk does not attempt to change states (e.g. quiesce the
device or switch between vhost kernel/QEMU, etc) while there are
in-flight requests. Instead all currently active requests must complete
(in some cases they can be cancelled to stop them early). Note that
failed requests can be kept in a list across the switch and then
resubmitted later.

The underlying storage never has requests in flight while the device is
switched. The reason QEMU does this is because there's no way to hand
over an in-flight preadv(2), Linux AIO, or other host kernel block layer
request to another process.
