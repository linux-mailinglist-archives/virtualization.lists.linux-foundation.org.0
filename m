Sure.  I just want to mention that the QEMU should be consistent
with the device (host). If QEMU enabled CONFIG_VHOST_VSOCK_DGRAM,
the device also needs to enable a similar option. Than the driver can
be old or new versions.

My bad. You are right, this is a new requirement for stream sockets.
Not a typo.  Maybe remove the part for stream sockets? Something
like following:

If VIRTIO_VSOCK_F_MRG_RXBUF is not negotiated, the driver SHOULD
populate the receive queue(s)
with buffers of  at least 4096 bytes for datagram sockets.
