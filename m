Any unprivileged user can check into this field to know parent device's capability without having to create a child vDPA device at all. The features that child vDPA device may support should be a subset of, or at most up to what the parent device offers. For e.g. the vdpa device dev1 you created below can expose less or equal device_features bit than 0x308820028 (MTU MAC CTRL_VQ CTRL_MAC_ADDR ANY_LAYOUT VERSION_1 ACCESS_PLATFORM), but shouldn't be no more than what the parent device can actually support.

Parav later pointed out that the corresponding enum definition for this attribute should follow pre-existing naming convention that we should perhaps do s/VDPA_ATTR_DEV_SUPPORTED_FEATURES/VDPA_ATTR_MGMTDEV_SUPPORTED_FEATURES/ to get it renamed, as this is a mgmtdev level attribute, which I agree. Now that with the upcoming "device_features" attribute (vdpa dev level) from this series, it's subject to another confusions between these two similar names, but actually would represent things at different level. While all other attributes in "mgmtdev dev show" seem to be aligned with the "supported_" prefix, e.g. supported_classes, max_supported_vqs, from which I think the stance of device is already implied through "mgmtdev" in the command. For the perspective of clarify and easy distinction, "supported_feat
 ures" seems to be a better name than "dev_features".

See another reply, I think I get your point,

1) VDPA_ATTR_VDPA_DEV_SUPPORTED_FEATURES (lingshan's series) and
VDPA_ATTR_VDPA_DEV_FEATURES should be equivalent and unified to a
single attribute.
2) A better name to "supported_features" should be fine, patches are welcomed

For vDPA live migration, what cares most is those configuration parameters specified on vdpa creation, and userspace VMM (QEMU) is supposed to take care of saving and restoring live device states. I think it's easier to extend "vdpa dev show" output to include device_features and other config params as well, rather than count on validity of various config space fields.

Probably, but for the migration it's more about the ability of the
mgmtdev instead of the vDPA device itself I think.

> It's not just insufficient, but sometimes is incorrect to create vDPA device using the config space fields.  For instance, MAC address in config space can be changed temporarily (until device reset) via ctrl_vq VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_MAC_ADDR_SET command. It's incorrect to create vDPA using the MAC address shown in the config space.

I think it's still a must for create the mac with the exact mac address:

1) VIRTIO_NET_F_CTRL_MAC is not a must
2) there's no way for us to know whether or not the mac has been changed
3) migration code can restore the mac during restore

So exactly the same mac address is still required. (This is the same
as we are doing for live migration on software virtio)

>  Another example, if the source vDPA device has MAC address table size limit of 100, then in the destination we should pick parent device with size limit no smaller than that, and create vDPA on remote node matching the exact same size. There's nothing config space field can assist here.

Two ways:

1) mgmtdev should show the mac table size so mgmt layer can provision
the mac table size
2) If the mac table exceeds what is supported in the destination, it
needs to enable the all uni in this case.

While I can't think of a case that the mgmt software or live migration tool would have to count on config space fields only.

Yes, in this case we need to introduce new netlink attributes for both
getting mandatory features from the management device and provisioning
those manadating features.

Note that even with the same vendor, mgmtdev may support different features.

To allow cross vendor live migration I couldn't find a better way.

Just to clarify, there won't be a device_features in mgmtdev show
since it is device specific, each individual device can have its own
device features which are subset of what is supported by the mgmtdev.

What device features you would expect the mgmt software to create destination vdpa device with, if not otherwise requiring mgmt software to remember all the arguments on device creation?

So the provisioning in the destination should use exactly the same
device_feautres as what the vdpa device has in the source. But before
this, management layer should guarantee to provision a vDPA device
whose device_features can be supported on the destination in order to
allow live migration.

For e.g. for cpu flags, mgmt software can infer the guest cpus features in use from all qemu command line arguments and host cpu features/capability, which doesn't need to remember creation arguments and is easy to recover from failure without having to make the VM config persistent in data store. I thought it would be great if vdpa CLI design could offer the same.

But I don't get the point for how it relates to exposing the actual value of device features? Are you saying in this case you'd rather expose the model name than the actual value of feature bits? Well, I think we can expose both in different fields when there's really such a need.

It's something like:

vdpa dev add name dev1 mgmtdev vdpasim_net device_features VDPA_NET_MODEL_1

and VDPA_NET_MODEL_1 implies some feature sets.

>

So creating vDPA device without "device_features" is somehow the host
model, it will have all features that is supported by the parent.

> I think this implies that mgmt software should have to understand what the model name really means in terms of individual CPU features, so having feature bit value exposed will just do more help if vDPA goes the same way.

Exactly.
