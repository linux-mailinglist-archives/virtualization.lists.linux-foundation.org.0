Based on Program Committee evaluation, a paper can be rejected or accepted =
by the Conference Chairs. In the later case, it can be accepted as the type=

 as short papers or poster papers only. Similarly, short papers can be acce=
pted as poster papers only.

Poster papers and Company papers are not published in the Conference Procee=
dings, being only presented and discussed. The authors of accepted poster p=
apers should build and print a poster to be exhibited during the Conference=

ludes Work Sessions where these posters are presented and orally discussed,=
 with a 7 minute limit per poster.

The authors of accepted Full papers will have 15 minutes to present their w=
ork in a Conference Work Session; approximately 5 minutes of discussion wil=
l follow each presentation. The authors of accepted Short papers and Compan=
y papers will have 11 minutes to present their work in a Conference Work Se=
ssion; approximately 4 minutes of discussion will follow each presentation.=
