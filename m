That would not be safe.  Userspace can change this timeout and the end
result with the current implementation of the driver is potentially
kernel memory corruption, which is something userspace of course never
should be able to trigger.

Even if the timeout were hardcoded in the driver and the driver made to
ignore what userspace requests, it would need to be set to a
ridiculously high value so that we can guarantee that the timeout never
ever occurs (since the result is potentially random kernel memory
corruption).  Which is basically equivalent to disabling the timeout
entirely as my patch does.

If the timeout cannot be disabled, then the driver should be fixed to
always copy buffers and hold on to them to avoid memory corruption in
the case of timeout, as I mentioned in my commit message.  That would be
quite a substantial change to the driver so it's not something I'm
personally comfortable with doing, especially not this late in the -rc
cycle, so I'd leave that to others.
