Great. Thanks for confirming it.

I have been thinking about this for some while today. Actually I am not 
against exposing the host queue index to the spec, as we know it's 
somewhat implicitly defined in the QEMU device model for multiqueue. The 
thing is, I'm not sure if there's extra benefit than this minor 
requirement (*) given that all of the other vDPA kAPI are taking the 
guest queue index rather than the host queue index. It works for 
mlx5_vdpa as the control vq is implemented in the software, so it can 
map to whatever guest qindex it wishes to. But would it cause extra 
trouble for some other emulated vDPA device or other vendor's vDPA such 
as ifcvf to fabricate a fake mapping between the host queue index and 
the one guest can see? I would have to send a heads-up ahead that the 
current vhost-vdpa mq implementation in upstream QEMU has some issue in 
mapping the host qindex to the guest one. This would become a problem 
with MQ enabled vdpa device and a non-MQ supporting guest e.g. OVMF, for 
which I'm about to share some RFC patches shortly to demonstrate the 
issue. If exposing the host queue index to the spec turns is essential 
to resolving this issue and maybe help with software virtio QEMU 
implementation too, I won't hesitate to expose this important 
implementation detail to the spec.

(*) another means that may somehow address my use case is to use some 
magic keyword e.g. "ctrlvq" to identify the control vq. Implementation 
wise, we can extensively pass -1 to indicate the last guest qindex to 
the get_vq_vstat() API given that we know for sure the ctrlvq is the 
last queue in the array when the relevant features are present. Since 
the negotiated features are piggybacked, it's not hard for the vdpa tool 
to tell apart whether the last queue is a control vq or not.

I'd also welcome other ideas that can make virtqueue identification 
easier and predictable from the CLI.

Thanks,
