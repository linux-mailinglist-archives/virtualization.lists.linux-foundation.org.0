I think that's mostly a historical accident; I'm not aware of a reaason we
can't put that directly in _cond_resched(). 

Since we started from out-of-line static call trampolines, even the out-of-line
static key check looked nicer, and I think we just never considered moving the
static key check inline.

That would be nice!

Ah, sorry -- I had missed that we had distinct static_call_cond() and
static_call() helpers.

Thanks,
