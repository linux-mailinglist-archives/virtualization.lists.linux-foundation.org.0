I think we already have a limit for the allocation. If a DGRAM client
sends packets while no socket is bound on the server side ,
the packet will be dropped when looking for the socket. If the socket is
bound on the server side, but the server program somehow does not
call recv or similar functions, the packets will be dropped when the
buffer is full as in your previous patch at here:
https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/1141083/
If there are still other cases that we don't have protection, let me know and
I can add some threshold.
