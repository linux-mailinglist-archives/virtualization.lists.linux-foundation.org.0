I see your point, and it makes sense to keep KMI on stable branches, but 
mainline I would like to have the proposed approach since all transports 
use it to cycle on their sockets.

So we could do a series with 2 patches:
- Patch 1 fixes the problem in all transports by checking the transport
   in the callback (here we insert the fixes tag so we backport it to the
   stable branches)
- Patch 2 moves the check in vsock_for_each_connected_socket() removing
   it from callbacks so it is less prone to errors and we merge it only
   mainline

What do you think?

Thanks,
Stefano
