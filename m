I don't think VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM would be correct for this because
the usage of swiotlb_xen is not a property of virtio, it is a detail of
the way Linux does Xen address translations. swiotlb-xen is used to do
these translations and it is hooked into the dma_ops framework.

It would be possible to have a device in hardware that is
virtio-compatible and doesn't set VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM. The device
could be directly assigned (passthrough) to a DomU. We would still
have to use swiotlb_xen if Xen is running.

You should think of swiotlb-xen as only internal to Linux and not
related to whether the (virtual or non-virtual) hardware comes with an
IOMMU or not.

swiotlb-xen is not used on Xen/ARM DomU, the default dma_ops are the
ones that are used. So you are saying, why don't we fix the default
dma_ops to work with virtio?

It is bad that the default dma_ops crash with virtio, so yes I think it
would be good to fix that. However, even if we fixed that, the if
(xen_domain()) check in vring_use_dma_api is still a problem.


Alternatively we could try to work-around it from swiotlb-xen. We could
enable swiotlb-xen for Xen/ARM DomUs with a different implementation so
that we could leave the vring_use_dma_api check unmodified.

It would be ugly because we would have to figure out from the new
swiotlb-xen functions if the device is a normal device, so we have to
call the regular dma_ops functions, or if the device is a virtio device,
in which case there is nothing to do. I think it is undesirable but
could probably be made to work.
