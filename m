Thanks for the context.

If Windows requires the driver to pass the hash-type along with the
hash data, then indeed this will be needed.

If it only requires the device to support a subset of of the possible
types, chosen at init, that would be different and it would be cheaper
for the driver to pass this config to the device one time.

Good catch on segmentation taking place between .ndo_select_queue and
.ndo_start_xmit.

That also means that whatever field in the skb is used, has to be
copied to all segments in skb_segment. Which happens for cb. But this
feature is completely unrelated to the skb_gso_cb type. Perhaps
another field with a real type is more clear. For instance, an
extension to the union with napi_id and sender_cpu, as neither is used
in this egress path with .ndo_select_queue?
