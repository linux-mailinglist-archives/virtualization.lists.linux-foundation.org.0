We need to make sure the callback can survive when it runs before sub

I meant for those driver, in probe they do()

virtio_device_ready()
subsystem_register()

In remove() they do

subsystem_unregister()
virtio_device_reset()

Yes, (the patches I've posted so far exist even with a well-behaved device).
