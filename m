Mike, sorry, I don't understand your email.

Just in case, let me remind I know nothing about drivers/vhost/

and you have mentioned in the next email that you have already coded something
like this, so perhaps we can delay the further discussions until you send the
new code?

Hmm... If we you CLONE_THREAD the exiting vhost_worker() will auto-reap itself,

can't comment, see above.

I just tried to point out that (unless I missed something) there are more corner
cases, not just coredump.

I meant that the vhost_task's sub-thread can do sys_clone(CLONE_FILES) from
userspace. Yes, this implies copy_process() but I still can't understand you.

> That type of thing is not needed.

Do you mean that userspace should never do this? But this doesn't matter, the
kernel should handle this case anyway.

Or what?

In short let me repeat that I don't understand you and - of course! - quite
possibly I missed something.

Oleg.
