Sure. I will keep the feature bit.

That is a valid concern. Let me explain how I would handle that if we
don't add two new virtqueues. For dgram, I also add a dgram_send_pkt_list,
which is similar to send_pkt_list for stream (and seqpacket). But there
is one difference. The dgram_send_pkt_list has a maximum size setting,
and keep tracking how many pkts are in the list. The track number
(dgram_send_pkt_list_size) is  increased when a packet is added
to the list and is decreased when a packet
is removed from the list and added to the virtqueue. In
virtio_transport_send_pkt, if the current
dgram_send_pkt_list_size is equal
to the maximum ( let's say 128), then it will not add to the
dgram_send_pkt_list and return an error to the application.

In this way, the number of pending dgram pkts to be sent is limited.
Then both stream and dgram sockets will compete to hold a lock
for the tx virtqueue. Depending on the linux scheduler, this competition
will be somewhat fair. As a result, dgram will not block stream completely.
It will compete and share the virtqueue with stream, but stream
can still send some pkts.

Basically, the virtqueue becomes a first-come first-serve resource for
the stream and dgram. When both stream and dgram applications
have lots of data to send, dgram_send_pkt_list and send_pkt_list
will still be a limited size, and each will have some chance to send out
the data via virtqueue.  Does this address your concern?

With 2 dedicated queues, we still need some kind of accounting for
the dgram. Like the dgram_send_pkt_size I mentioned above.  Otherwise,
it will cause OOM. It is not a real credit mechanism, but code is similar
with or without 2 dedicated queues in my current prototype.

For receiver discarding packets part, could you explain more? I think
receiver discarding pkts code also is same with or without 2 dedicated
queues. Both will use can_enqueue = virtio_transport_inc_rx_pkt(vvs, pkt);
to check if a packet should be discarded or not.

Thanks,

Jiang
