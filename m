Ah yes that makes sense.

Hm I thought vmap is meant to pin itself, and not rely on any other
pinning done already. And from a quick look through the long call chain
for amd (which is currently the only driver supporting dynamic dma-buf)
that seems to be the case.

But yeah the locking isn't specificied yet, and that makes it a bit a mess

d.com/

Wrt this patch series here I'm wondering whether we could do an interim
solution that side-steps the dma_buf_vmap mess.

- in shmem helpers pin any vmapped buffer (it's how dma-buf works too),
  and that pinning would be done under dma_resv_lock (like with other
  drivers using dma_resv_lock for bo protection)

- switch over everything else except vmap code to dma_resv_lock, but leave
  vmap locking as-is

- shrinker then only needs to trylock dma_resv_trylock in the shrinker,
  which can check for pinned buffer and that's good enough to exclude
  vmap'ed buffer. And it avoids mixing the vmap locking into the new
  shrinker code and driver interfaces.

This still leaves the vmap locking mess as-is, but I think that's a mess
that's orthogonal to shrinker work.

Thoughts?
