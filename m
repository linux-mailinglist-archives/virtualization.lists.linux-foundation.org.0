Right, I forgot that, will update the patch and add the correct noinstr
annotations.

VC_SAFE_STACK does not imply from-user. It means that the #VC handler
asm code was able to switch away from the IST stack to either the
task-stack (if from-user or syscall gap) or to the previous kernel
stack. There is a check in vc_switch_off_ist() that shows which stacks
are considered safe.

If it can not switch to a safe stack the VC entry code switches to the
fall-back stack and a special handler function is called, which for now
just panics the system.

So #VC is different from #DB and #MCE in that it switches stacks even
when coming from kernel mode, so that the #VC handler can be nested.
What I can do is to call the from_user function directly from asm in
the .Lfrom_user_mode_switch_stack path. That will avoid having another
from_user check in C code.

The on_vc_fallback_stack() path is for now only calling panic(), because
it can't be hit when the hypervisor is behaving correctly. In the future
it is not clear yet if that path needs to be extended for SNP page
validation exceptions, which can basically happen anywhere.

The implementation of SNP should make sure that all memory touched
during entry (while on unsafe stacks) is always validated, but not sure
yet if that holds when live-migration of SNP guests is added to the
picture.

There is the possibility that this doesn't fit in the above branch, but
it can also be moved to a separate function if needed.

Okay, I am going to try this out. Thanks for your feedback.
