A record can be sent using one or more output operations and received using one or more input operations, but a single operation never transfers part of more than one record.

It was the same concern I had with the series that introduced SEQPACKET 
for vsock, which is why I suggested to wait until the message is 
complete, before copying it to the user's buffer.

IIUC, with the current upstream implementation, we don't have this 
problem, right?

I'm not sure how to fix this, other than by keeping all the fragments 
queued until we've successfully copied them to user space, which is what 
we should do without this series applied IIUC.
