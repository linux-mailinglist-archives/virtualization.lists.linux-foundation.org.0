Thanks Jason. Yes, that makes sense to me.

The difference from 32 to 64 bit between virtio_pci_legacy.c and
virtio_pci_modern.c is a good example:

  static u64 vp_get_features(struct virtio_device *vdev)
  {
        struct virtio_pci_device *vp_dev = to_vp_device(vdev);

        /* When someone needs more than 32 feature bits, we'll need to
         * steal a bit to indicate that the rest are somewhere else. */
        return ioread32(vp_dev->ioaddr + VIRTIO_PCI_HOST_FEATURES);
 }

  u64 vp_modern_get_features(struct virtio_pci_modern_device *mdev)
  {
        struct virtio_pci_common_cfg __iomem *cfg = mdev->common;

        u64 features;

        vp_iowrite32(0, &cfg->device_feature_select);
        features = vp_ioread32(&cfg->device_feature);
        vp_iowrite32(1, &cfg->device_feature_select);
        features |= ((u64)vp_ioread32(&cfg->device_feature) << 32);

        return features;
  }

device_feature_select is a 32-bit field, of which only values 0 and 1
are defined so far, per the virtio 1.1 spec:

"
device_feature_select
The driver uses this to select which feature bits device_feature
shows. Value 0x0 selects Feature Bits 0 to 31, 0x1 selects Feature
Bits 32 to 63, etc.
"

That leaves plenty of room for expansion, at least for pci devices.
