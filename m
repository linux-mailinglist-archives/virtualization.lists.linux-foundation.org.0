With my proposal no - only if we also kick before registration.
So I do not see the issue yet.

Consider ./net/vmw_vsock/virtio_transport.c

kicks: virtio_transport_send_pkt_work,
virtio_vsock_rx_fill, virtio_vsock_event_fill

which of these triggers before we are ready to
handle callbacks?

Let's leave remove alone for now. I am close to 100% sure we have *lots*
of issues around it, but while probe is unavoidable remove can be
avoided by blocking hotplug.

patches you posted deal with DRIVER_OK spec compliance.
I do not see patches for kicks before callbacks are ready to run.
