I agree that adding them to -s is fine (and that resolves my "no one
will find them" complain as well). If it crowds the output we could also
default to only output'ing a subset, and have the more detailed
statistics hidden behind a verbose switch (or even just in the JSON
output)?

I don't think it's accurate to call the admin use case "hypothetical".
We're expending a significant effort explaining to people that XDP can
"eat" your packets, and not having any standard statistics makes this
way harder. We should absolutely cater to our "early adopters", but if
we want XDP to see wider adoption, making it "less weird" is critical!

IMO, as long as the packets are accounted for in the regular XDP stats,
having a whole separate set of stats only for XSK is less important.

I personally find the per-channel stats quite useful. One of the primary
reasons for not achieving full performance with XDP is broken
configuration of packet steering to CPUs, and having per-channel stats
is a nice way of seeing this. I can see the point about them being way
too verbose in the default output, though, and I do generally filter the
output as well when viewing them. But see my point above about only
printing a subset of the stats by default; per-channel stats could be
JSON-only, for instance?
