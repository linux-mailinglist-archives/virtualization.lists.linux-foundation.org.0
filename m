All three commands from the beginning of that switch in trigger op:
ops->trigger(START)
ops->trigger(PAUSE_RELEASE)
ops->trigger(RESUME)

They all result in
virtsnd_ctl_msg_send_sync(VIRTIO_SND_R_PCM_START)

And that command must be sync, i.e. we need to wait/sleep until device
sent response. There are two major reasons for that: we need to be sure,
that substream has been actually started (i.e. device said OK). And we
need to take into account the virtualization overhead as well. Since
substream starting on device side may take some time, we can not
return from the trigger op until it actually happened. In atomic mode
all these nuances are lost, and it may lead to incorrect application
behavior.

Then it's definitely some work for future. :)
