Microsoft's spec tells us that they're giving us cryptographically
random numbers. Where they're getting those from is not our problem.
(And if even the hypervisor is not able to collect enough entropy to
securely generate random numbers, worrying about RNG reseeding in the
guest would be kinda pointless, we'd be fairly screwed anyway.)

Also note that we don't actually need to *always* reinitialize RNG
state on forks for functional correctness; it is fine if that fails
with a probability of 2^-128, because functionally everything will be
fine, and an attacker who is that lucky could also just guess an AES
key (which has the same probability of being successful). (And also
2^-128 is such a tiny number that it doesn't matter anyway.)

If your SSH host key was shared with 89 other hosts, it evidently
wasn't generated from cryptographically random numbers. :P Either
because the key generator was not properly hooked up to the system's
entropy pool (if you're talking about the Debian fiasco), or because
the system simply did not have enough entropy available. (Or because
the key generator is broken, but I don't think that ever happened with
OpenSSH?)
