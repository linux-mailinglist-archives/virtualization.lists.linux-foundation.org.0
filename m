It is not a recursion count, it is a stack-recursion check. Basically
walk down the stack and look if your current stack is already in use.
Yes, this can be optimized, but that is what is needed.

IIRC the current prototype code for SNP just pre-validates all memory in
the VM and doesn't support moving pages around on the host. So any #VC
SNP exception would be fatal, yes.

In a scenario with on-demand validation of guest pages and support for
guest-assisted page-moving on the HV side it would be more complicated.
Basically all memory that is accessed during #VC exception handling must
stay validated at all times, including the IST stack.

So saying this, I don't understand why _all_ SNP #VC exceptions from
kernel space must be fatal?
