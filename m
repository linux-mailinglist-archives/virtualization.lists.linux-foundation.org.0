Yes, each hypervisor needs to support it.
We could simplify the design and implementation to the minimal, so that each hypervisor can easily support it.
Once every hypervisor has the support, the guest (MigTD) could be a unified version.
(e.g. no need for each hypervisor user to develop their own MigTD using their own vsock transport)

We thought about virtio-mmio. There are some barriers:
1) It wasn't originally intended for x86 machines. The only machine type in QEMU
that supports it (to run on x86) is microvm. But "microvm" doesn’t support TDX currently,
and adding this support might need larger effort.
2) It's simpler than virtio-pci, but still more complex than hypercall.
3) Some CSPs don't have virtio support in their software, so this might add too much development effort for them.

This usage doesn’t need high performance, so faster hypercall for signalling isn't required, I think.
(but if hypercall has been verified to be much faster than the current EPT misconfig based notification,
it could be added for the general virtio usages)

This doesn’t include the PCI enumeration in seaBIOS and the PCI driver in the guest though.

Virtio has high performance, I think that's an important reason that more devices are continually added.
For this transport, I couldn’t envision that a bunch of devices would be added. It's a simple PV method.

Why hypercall wouldn't be possible for nested virt?
L2 hypercall goes to L0 directly and L0 can decide whether to forward the call the L1 (in our case, I think no need as the packet will go out), right?

Its drawbacks are obvious (e.g. low performance). 
In general, I think it could be considered as a complement to virtio.
I think most usages would choose virtio as they don’t worry about the complexity and they purse high performance.
For some special usages that think virtio is too complex to suffice and they want something simpler, they would consider to use this transport。

Thanks,
Wei
