The practical results mirror what the theory suggests: that in the
presence of multiple paths, of which one goes bad, this method
maintains connectivity where otherwise it would disconnect.

When IPv6 FlowLabel was included in path selection (e.g., LAG/ECMP),
flowlabel rotation on TCP timeout avoided the vast majority of TCP
disconnections that would otherwise have occurred during to link
failures in long-haul backbones, when an alternative path was
available.

So it's not a matter of percentages, just the existence of an
alternative healthy path on which the packets will eventually land
quite deterministically as it rotates the txhash on each timeout.

This method can be deployed based on a variety of "bad connection"
signals. Besides timeouts, the aforementioned spurious retransmits,
for one. This TCP connection-level information can independent of
flowlabel rotation be valuable information to the cloud provider to
detect and pinpoint network issues. As mentioned before, ideally we
can pass along such details of the type of signal along with the hash.
But that also requires passing that state in the guest from the TCP
layer to the virtio-net device. So left for separate later work. For
now we just have the reserved space in the header.

Michael, what is the best way to proceed with this? Send the patches
for review to net-next, or should I start by opening ballots to
https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ballots.php?wg_abbrev=virtio
first? Thanks.
