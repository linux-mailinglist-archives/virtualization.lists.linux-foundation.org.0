Hi Jiang,
I think we should discuss this changes on 
virtio-comment@lists.oasis-open.org, so I CCed the list.

As suggested by Michael here [1] we should add also a feature bit for 
stream, and maybe is better to reserve bit 0 for it.

Arseny already sent an implementation of SEQPACKET using bit 1 for 
VIRTIO_VSOCK_F_SEQPACKET, so I think we can use bit 2 for DGRAM and bit 
3 for MRG_RXBUF.

Should we add a new `struct virtio_vsock_packet` description used when 
VIRTIO_VSOCK_F_MRG_RXBUF is negotiated?

If VIRTIO_VSOCK_F_MRG_RXBUF was not negotiated, we use only 
virtio_vsock_hdr where there isn't `num_buffers`, so it is not clear to 
me this statement.
