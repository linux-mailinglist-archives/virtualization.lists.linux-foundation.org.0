I see and I agree on that, let's do it step by step.
If we can do it in the first phase is great, but I think is fine to add
this feature later.

We need to understand where the packet can be lost.
If the packet always reaches the destination (vsock driver or device),
we can discard it, but also update the counters.

Right, the other problem I see is that the socket aren't connected, so
we have 1-N relationship.

I see, it looks interesting, but I think we need to share that
information between multiple sockets, since the same destination
(cid, port), can be reached by multiple sockets.

Another approach could be to have both congestion notification and
decongestion, but maybe it produces double traffic.

Yep I agree. I think our advantage is that the channel (virtqueues),
can't lose packets.
