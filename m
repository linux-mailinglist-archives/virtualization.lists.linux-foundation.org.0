TBH I feel inclined to take the simpler approach of just splitting the 
rcache array to a separate allocation, making init_iova_rcaches() public 
(with a proper return value), and tweaking put_iova_domain() to make 
rcache cleanup conditional. A residual overhead of 3 extra pointers in 
iova_domain doesn't seem like *too* much for non-DMA-API users to bear. 
Unless you want to try generalising the rcache mechanism completely away 
from IOVA API specifics, it doesn't seem like there's really enough to 
justify the bother of having its own distinct abstraction layer.

Cheers,
Robin.
