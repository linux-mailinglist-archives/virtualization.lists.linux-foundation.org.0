This looks fragile. How about the features that are mutually
exclusive? E.g FEATURE_X and FEATURE_Y that are both supported by the
mgmt?

I fully agree, but what I want to say is. Consider:

1) We've already had feature provisioning
2) It would be hard or even impossible to mandate the semantic
(consistency) of the features inheritance.

I'm fine with the doc, but the mgmt layer should not depend on this
and they should use feature provisioning instead.

Just want to go wild because we can't expect how many layers are below vDPA.

vDPA core is the right place but the validating should be done during
feature provisioning since it's much more easier than trying to
mandating code defined behaviour like inheritance.

It can still work in a passive way, mgmt layer check the device
features and only allow the migration among the vDPA devices that have
the same device_feature. Less flexible than feature provisioning.

I think this is already been done ,or anything I miss?

I'm not sure it's a bug consider a vDPA device have only a subset
feature of what mgmt has.

Well, this is what has been already done right now before the feature
provisioning, the kernel for anyway needs to validate the illegal
input from userspace.

So as discussed before, the kernel has already tried to do validation,
if there's any bug, we can fix that. If you meant userspace
validation, I'm not sure it is necessary:

1) kernel should do the validation
2) hard to keep forward compatibility, e.g features supported by the
mgmt device might not be even known by the userspace.
