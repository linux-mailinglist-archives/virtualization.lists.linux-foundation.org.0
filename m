The problem is you can't guarantee that adap->algo->master_xfer
is only called from i2c_transfer. Any function who holds the adapter can 
call
adap->algo->master_xfer directly. I prefer to avoid potential issues 
rather than
find a issue then fix.

My understanding is that new driver sets this to warn users that the 
adapter doesn't support classes anymore.

I'm not sure if Wolfram can explain it more clear for you.

Will make vi->adap a pointer. Thanks.
