Yes, it is. Actually what I mean is that small files (with size smaller
than dax window chunk size) is more likely to consume more dax windows
compared to large files, under the same total file size.

Yes, agreed. In this case, the meaning of per-file dax is that, admin
could control the size of overall dax window under a limited number,
while still sustaining a reasonable performance. But at least, users are
capable of tuning it now.

OK. I will send a new version, disabling dax based on the file size on
the host daemon side. Besides, I'm afraid the negotiation phase is also
not needed anymore, since currently the hint whether dax shall be
enabled or not is completely feeded from host daemon, and the guest side
needn't set/clear per inode dax attr now.
