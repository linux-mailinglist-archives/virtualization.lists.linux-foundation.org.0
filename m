This sounds reasonable, I'd suggest you reserve MSHV_CAP_CORE_API_STABLE
right away but don't expose it yet so it's clear the API is not yet
stable. Test userspace you have may always assume it's running with the
latest kernel.

Also, please be clear about the fact that /dev/mshv doesn't
provide a stable API yet so nobody builds an application on top of
it.

One more though: it is probably a good idea to introduce selftests for
/dev/mshv (similar to KVM's selftests in
/tools/testing/selftests/kvm). Selftests don't really need a stable ABI
as they live in the same linux.git and can be updated in the same patch
series which changes /dev/mshv behavior. Selftests are very useful for
checking there are no regressions, especially in the situation when
there's no publicly available userspace for /dev/mshv.
