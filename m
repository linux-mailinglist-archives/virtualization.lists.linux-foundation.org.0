It's on my diagram, and yes, forgot to add it here.

driver stats are important too. e.g., mlx5's cache stats and per-queue
stats.

I just ran some quick tests with my setup and measured about 1.2% worst
case. Certainly not exhaustive. Perhaps Intel or Mellanox can provide
numbers for their high speed nics - e.g. ConnectX-6 and a saturated host.

stats is one of the many sensitive topics. I have been consistent in
defending the need to use existing APIs and tooling and not relying on
XDP program writers to add the relevant stats and then provide whatever
tool is needed to extract and print them. Standardization for
fundamental analysis tools.
