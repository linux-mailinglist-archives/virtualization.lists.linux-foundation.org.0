This is *precisely* why I was against adding a flag and touch the
protocol negociation with qemu in the first place, back when I cared
about that stuff...

Guys, this has gone in circles over and over again.

This has nothing to do with qemu. Qemu doesn't need to know about this.
It's entirely guest local. This is why the one-liner in virtio was a
far better and simpler solution.

This is something the guest does to itself (with the participation of a
ultravisor but that's not something qemu cares about at this stage, at
least not as far as virtio is concerned).

Basically, the guest "hides" its memory from the host using a HW secure
memory facility. As a result, it needs to ensure that all of its DMA
pages are bounced through insecure pages that aren't hidden. That's it,
it's all guest side. Qemu shouldn't have to care about it at all.

Cheers,
Ben.
