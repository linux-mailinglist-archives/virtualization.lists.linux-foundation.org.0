Right, it's our initial requirement.

Saying we want to access 4KB of one file inside guest, if it goes
through FUSE request routine, then the fuse daemon only need to download
this 4KB from remote server. But if it goes through DAX, then the fuse
daemon need to download the whole DAX window (e.g., 2MB) from remote
server, so called amplification. Maybe we could decrease the DAX window
size, but it's a trade off.

Apart from our internal requirement, more fine grained control for DAX
shall be general and more flexible. Glad to hear more discussion from
community.
