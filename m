It's not just e2fsprogs and xfsprogs.  There's also udev, blkid,
potententially systemd unit generators to kick off fsck runs, etc.
There are probably any number of user scripts which assume that file
systems are mounted on block devices --- for example, by looking at
the output of lsblk, etc.

Also note that block devices have O_EXCL support to provide locking
against attempts to run mkfs on a mounted file system.  If you move
dax file systems to be mounted on a character mode device, that would
have to be replicated as well, etc.  So I suspect that a large number
of subtle things would break, and I'd strongly recommend against going
down that path.
