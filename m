I saw that, but that was also a week ago already, so I slowly started to
wonder if plans might have/should be changed. Anyway: if that's still
the plan forward it's totally fine for me if it's fine for Linus. :-D

BTW: I for now didn't sit down to test Mike's patches, as due to all the
discussions I assumed new ones would be coming sooner or later anyway.
If it's worth giving them a shot, please let me know.
