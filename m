I think it was just me creating a confusion here.

fwiw I do also think that shrinker in shmem helpers makes sense, just in
case that was also lost in confusion.

Hm but why don't you just nuke the memory on the host side too when you
evict? Allowing the guest memory to be swapped out while keeping the host
memory allocation alive also doesn't make a lot of sense for me. Both can
be recreated (I guess at least?) on swap-in.
