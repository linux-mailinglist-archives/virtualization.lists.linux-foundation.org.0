Good point. You're right.

Moving the shadow vq to the kernel later would be quite a big change
requiring rewriting much of the code. That's why I mentioned this now
before a lot of effort is invested in a QEMU implementation.

If the performance is acceptable with the QEMU approach then I think
that's the best place to implement it. It looks high-overhead though so
maybe one of the first things to do is to run benchmarks to collect data
on how it performs?
