From: "jiang.wang" <jiang.wang@bytedance.com>

Add supports for datagram type for virtio-vsock. Datagram
sockets are connectionless and unreliable. To avoid contention
with stream and other sockets, add two more virtqueues and
a new feature bit to identify if those two new queues exist or not.

Also add descriptions for resource management of datagram, which
does not use the existing credit update mechanism associated with
stream sockets.

Signed-off-by: Jiang Wang <jiang.wang@bytedance.com>
---

V2: addressed the comments for the previous version.
V3: add description for the mergeable receive buffer.
V4: add a feature bit for stream and reserver a bit for seqpacket.
Fix mrg_rxbuf related sentences.
