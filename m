Well, not actually.

The host can actually be anything. It can be a Xen based dom0, which
runs some proprietary firmware, or Qemu running over Linux.

It is left for the host to decide how it wants to club together the
GPIO pins from host and access them, with Linux host userspace it
would be playing with /dev/gpiochipN, while for a raw one it may
be accessing registers directly.

And so the backend running at host, needs to pass the gpiochip
configurations and only the host understand it.

The way I test it for now is by running this with Qemu over my x86
box, so my host side is indeed playing with sysfs Linux.

Not sure if I understand the aggregator thing for now, but we see the
backend running at host (which talks to this Linux driver at guest) as
a userspace thing and not a kernel driver. Not sure if aggregator can
be used like that, but anyway..

I am not very clear on the rpmsg thing, I know couple of folks at
project Stratos were talking about it :)

@Alex, want to chime in here for me ? :)

The credit goes to Enrico for this :)

Oh, that's nice. I will surely do that.

That's the plan.

Yes, Virtio presents features for this. The patch 2/3 already uses one
for IRQs. We won't need to bump up the IDs :)
