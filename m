Right, but if 99900 out of 100000 interrupts were wasted, then it is
surely an even greater win to disable interrupts while polling like
this.  Might be tricky to detect, disabling/enabling aggressively every
time even if there's nothing in the queue is sure to cause lots of cache
line bounces, and we don't want to enable callbacks if they were not
enabled e.g. by start_xmit ...  Some kind of counter?
