FWIW I actually got about half-way through writing my own equivalent of 
patches 2-3, except tackling it from the other direction - simplifying 
the FQ code *before* moving whatever was left to iommu-dma, then I got 
side-tracked trying to make io-pgtable use that freelist properly, and 
then I've been on holiday the last 2 weeks. I've got other things to 
catch up on first but I'll try to get to this later this week.

I think the FQ code is mostly just here as a historical artefact, since 
the IOVA allocator was the only thing common to the Intel and AMD DMA 
ops when the common FQ implementation was factored out of those, so 
although it's essentially orthogonal it was still related enough that it 
was an easy place to stick it.

Cheers,
Robin.
