Hi Arseniy,
I left some comments in the patches, and I'm adding something also here:

If it is not too time-consuming, can we have a table/list to compare this 
and the TCP zerocopy?

In order to have a "userspace polling-friendly approach" and reduce 
number of syscall, can we allow for example the userspace to mmap at 
least the first header before packets arrive.
Then the userspace can poll a flag or other fields in the header to 
understand that there are new packets.

That would be cool, but in the meantime it would be nice to behave 
similarly to TCP, which is why the comparison table I mentioned earlier 
would be useful.

Yep, but I think we should not allow to change it while we are connected 
(see comments in the patches.)

Do you mean a build config like CONFIG_VSOCK_ZERO_COPY?

I'm not sure it's needed.

Thanks,
