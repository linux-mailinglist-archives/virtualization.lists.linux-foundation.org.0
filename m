Hi Cornelia,

Thanks for the insightful comments and ideas. Answers below:

How about this as an introduction?

    Virtio is an open standard that defines a protocol to communicate
    drivers and devices of different types, see Chapter 5 ("Device
    Types") of the virtio spec `[1]`_. Originally developed as a
    standard for paravirtualized devices implemented by a hypervisor, it
    can be used to interface any compliant device (real or emulated)
    with a driver.

    For illustrative purposes, this document will focus on the common
    case of a Linux kernel running in a virtual machine and using
    paravirtualized devices provided by the hypervisor, which exposes
    them as virtio devices via standard mechanisms such as PCI.

Got it.

Ok, I'll simplify the intro to this:

    This document serves as a basic guideline for driver programmers
    that need to hack a new virtio driver or understand the essentials
    of the existing ones. See :ref:`Virtio on Linux <virtio>` for a
    general overview of virtio.

Ack.

Ack.

Sure, I'll add all of these to the next version.

Cheers,
Ricardo
