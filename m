Given our default chunk size is 2MB (FUSE_DAX_SHIFT), may be it is not
a bad idea to enforce some minimum cache window size. IIRC, even one
range is not enough. Minimum 2 are required for reclaim to not deadlock.

Hence, I guess it is not a bad idea to check for cache window size and
if it is too small, reject it and disable dax.
