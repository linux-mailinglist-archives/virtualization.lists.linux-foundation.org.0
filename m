That sounds more an argument that all of the existing "kernel is using
this region" cases should become mandatory exclusions. If unloading
the driver removes the exclusion then that's precisely
CONFIG_IO_STRICT_DEVMEM. Why is the virtio-mem driver more special
than any other driver that expects this integrity guarantee?

That would be like blocking writes to /dev/sda just because a
filesytem might later be mounted on it. If the /dev/mem access is not
actively colliding with other kernel operations what business does the
kernel have saying no?

I'm pushing on this topic because I am also considering an exclusion
on PCI configuration access to the "DOE mailbox" since it can disrupt
the kernel's operation, at the same time, root can go change PCI BARs
to nonsensical values whenever it wants which is also in the category
of "has no use case && could be harmful".

Yes, I wanted to tease out more of your rationale on where the line
should be drawn, I think a mostly unfettered /dev/mem mode is here to
stay.
