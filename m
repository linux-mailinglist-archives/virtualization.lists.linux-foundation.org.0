=3D=3D=3D Overview =3D=3D=3D
The ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and
Distributed Computing (HPDC) will include a poster session with an
associated 2-page extended abstract, which will be included in the HPDC
2022 proceedings. The topics of interest follow the regular paper
submission and include (but are not limited to): cloud computing, cluster
computing, edge computing, big data, massively multicore, AI for systems,
and extreme-scale computing systems. Accepted posters will be given the
opportunity to present their work in a dedicated lightning-/blitz-session
(using in-person presentation or virtual presentation) during the main
conference.

=3D=3D=3D Submission Guidelines =3D=3D=3D
We invite authors to submit poster contributions in the form of a two-page
extended abstract and a poster draft. Abstracts should be formatted in the
ACM Proceedings Style and submitted via the poster submission web site (to
be announced). Each submission should include a title, all author names and
affiliations, notes whether any of the authors are students, and an
indication of which author is corresponding/presenting the material. Poster
abstracts will be reviewed by the poster program committee through a
single-blind process and will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
=E2=80=A2 Submissions must describe new and interesting ideas related to HP=
DC
