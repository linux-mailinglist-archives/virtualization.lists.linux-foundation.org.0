You should lay out the use case + measurements. Further you should
describe what this patch set actually does, how behavior can be tuned,
pros and cons, etc... And you should most probably keep this RFC.

Nothing speaks about getting it right from the beginning. Otherwise it
will most likely never happen.

You should really point out what changed size the last version. I
remember Alex and Mike had some pretty solid points of what they don't
want to see (especially: don't use free page reporting infrastructure
and don't temporarily allocate huge pages for processing them).

I am not convinced that we want to use the free page reporting
infrastructure for this (pre-zeroing huge pages). What speaks about a
thread simply iterating over huge pages one at a time, zeroing them? The
whole free page reporting infrastructure was invented because we have to
do expensive coordination (+ locking) when going via the hypervisor. For
the main use case of zeroing huge pages in the background, I don't see a
real need for that. If you believe this is the right thing to do, please
add a discussion regarding this.
