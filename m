Okay, we figured out now that you _haven't_ subscribed to virtio lists
and so your stuff never landed in anyone's inbox. But you did send
something and didn't completely went away.

Since you started this all and still want to do it, I will take my
patches back and let you finish with what you started. I will help
review them.

Please start with specification first, and resend them as soon as
possible. So we can start with reviews there.

Also please cc relevant people directly, like GPIO maintainers in
kernel and few more from CC list of this email, as most of these
people aren't subscribed to virtio lists, they will never get your
patches otherwise. Lets get over this once and for all.
