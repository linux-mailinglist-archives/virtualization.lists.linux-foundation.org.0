This really looks like a mess :(

We end up calling ->finalize_features twice: once before ->validate, and
once after, that time with the complete song and dance. The first time,
we operate on one feature set; after validation, we operate on another,
and there might be interdependencies between the two (like a that a bit
is cleared because of another bit, which would not happen if validate
had a chance to clear that bit before).

I'm not sure whether that is even a problem in the spec: while the
driver may read the config before finally accepting features, it does
not really make sense to do so before a feature bit as basic as
VERSION_1 which determines the endianness has been negotiated. For
VERSION_1, we can probably go ahead and just assume that we will accept
it if offered, but what about other (future) bits?
