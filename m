OK. Will do. In my implementation, the order is preserved because
there is only one virtqueue. But I think we can put unordered in the spec.

OK. I think one way is to support fragmentation as suggested by Stefano.

In the linux kernel in my prototype, datagram sockets also use
virtio_transport_inc_rx_pkt() and virtio_transport_dec_rx_pkt() to update
vvs->rx_bytes and compare it with vvs->buf_alloc. virtio_transport_inc_rx_pkt
is called when enqueuing the datagram packets.
virtio_transport_dec_rx_pkt is called when dequeuing those packets.

If multiple sources send messages to the same destination, they will share
the same buf_alloc. Do you want something with more control?
Maybe somehow allocate a buffer for each remote CID and port? But I
feel that is a little bit overkill. Any other suggestions?

I think datagram sockets should do the same thing as the stream to
return a VIRTIO_VSOCK_OP_RST?
Any other ideas?

Yeah, I was thinking about the application interface. I will drop this
sentence.

Thanks for all the feedback.
