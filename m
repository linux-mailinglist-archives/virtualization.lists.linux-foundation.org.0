Actually I might be wrong. It probably should work. Looking at
implementation.

fuse_conn_waiting_read() looks at fc->num_waiting to figure out
how many requests are in flight.

And either fuse_get_req()/fuse_simple_request() will bump up the
fc->num_request count and fuse_put_request() will drop that count
once request completes. And this seems to be independent of
virtiofs.

So looks like it should work even with virtiofs. Please give it a try.

I guess fair enough. I don't mind creating "control" file system for
virtiofs. Either we don't create "abort" file or may be somehow
writing to file returns error. I guess both the solutions should
work.
