But what about all the I/O-coherent PL330s? :P (IIRC you can actually 
make a Juno do that with S2CR.MTCFG hacks...)

Yeah, I'm not necessarily against adding this as a horrible bodge for 
now - the reality is that people using VFIO must be doing it on coherent 
systems or it wouldn't be working properly anyway - as long as we all 
agree that that's what it is.

Next cycle I'll be sending the follow-up patches to bring 
device_iommu_capable() to its final form (hoping the outstanding VDPA 
patch lands in the meantime), at which point we get to sort-of-fix the 
SMMU drivers[1], and can do something similar here too. I guess the main 
question for virtio-iommu is whether it needs to be described/negotiated 
in the protocol itself, or can be reliably described by other standard 
firmware properties (with maybe just a spec not to clarify that 
coherency must be consistent).

Cheers,
Robin.
