For virtio-mem, there is no use case *and* access could be harmful; I 
don't even want to allow if for debugging purposes. If you want to 
inspect virtio-mem device memory content, use /proc/kcore, which 
performs proper synchronized access checks. Modifying random virtio-mem 
memory via /dev/mem in a debug kernel will not be possible: if you 
really have to play with fire, use kdb or better don't load the 
virtio-mem driver during boot, such that the kernel won't even be making 
use of device memory.

I don't want people disabling CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM, or booting with 
"iomem=relaxed", and "accidentally" accessing any of virtio-mem memory 
via /dev/mem, while it gets concurrently plugged/unplugged by the 
virtio-mem driver. Not even for debugging purposes.

We disallow mapping to some other regions independent of 
CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM already, so the idea to ignore CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM 
is not completely new:

"Note that with PAT support enabled, even in this case there are 
restrictions on /dev/mem use due to the cache aliasing requirements."

Maybe you even want to do something similar with PMEM now that there is 
infrastructure for it and just avoid having to deal with revoking 
/dev/mem mappings later.


I think there are weird debugging/educational setups [1] that still 
require CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM=n even with iomem=relaxed. Take a look at 
lib/devmem_is_allowed.c:devmem_is_allowed(), it disallows any access to 
(what's currently added as) System RAM. It might just do what people 
want when dealing with system RAM that doesn't suddenly vanish , so I 
don't ultimately see why we should remove CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM=n.
