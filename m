The point wasn't that it was necessarily a good and justifiable example, 
just that it is one that exists, to demonstrate that in general we have 
no reasonable heuristic for guessing whether ->map_pages is going to 
succeed or not other than by calling it and seeing if it succeeds or 
not. And IMO it's a complete waste of time thinking about ways to make 
such a heuristic possible instead of just getting on with fixing 
iommu_domain_alloc() to make the problem disappear altogether. Once 
Joerg pushes out the current queue I'll rebase and resend v4 of the bus 
ops removal, then hopefully get back to despairing at the hideous pile 
of WIP iommu_domain_alloc() patches I currently have on top of it...

Thanks,
Robin.
