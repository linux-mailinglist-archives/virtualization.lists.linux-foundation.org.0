Hmm, I think we just need the balloon driver to trigger the shrinker
in the guest kernel?  I suppose a driver like drm/virtio might want to
differentiate between host and guest pressure (ie. consider only
objects that have host vs guest storage), but even without that,
freeing up memory in the guest when host is under memory pressure
seems worthwhile.  Maybe I'm over-simplifying?

I think we don't want to do that, because MADV:WILLNEED would be by
far the most frequent guest<->host synchronous round trip.  So from
that perspective tracking madvise state in guest kernel seems quite
attractive.

If we really can't track madvise state in the guest for dealing with
host memory pressure, I think the better option is to introduce
MADV:WILLNEED_REPLACE, ie. something to tell the host kernel that the
buffer is needed but the previous contents are not (as long as the GPU
VA remains the same).  With this the host could allocate new pages if
needed, and the guest would not need to wait for a reply from host.

Yes, sorry, I meant that it is not using guest storage.
