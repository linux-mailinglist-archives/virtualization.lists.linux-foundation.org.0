Yep, I it should have been.

static void *vsock_start(struct seq_file *m, loff_t *pos)
	__acquires(rcu)
{
	[...]

}

static void vsock_stop(struct seq_file *m, void *p)
	__releases(rcu)
{
	[...]
}

static int vsock_show(struct seq_file *m, void *v)
	__must_hold(rcu)
{
	[...]
}


And guess what? I just copied those annotations from sock_hash_seq_start(),
sock_hash_seq_show() and sock_hash_seq_stop() from net/core/sock_map.c
which is doing exactly the same thing ;-)

So there's definitely precedence for this.

Awesome, thanks!
