Heya!

Thank you for pointing this out! I've a couple of questions and hope you can
help me out with them.

Also CC-ing AMD / TDX folks.

That is fairly simple to implement I would think. That is it can check
that the dma_addr is from the PA in the io_tlb pool when SWIOTLB=force
is used.

So.. this sounds very similar to the Intel Thunder.. something issue
where this exact issue was fixed by handing the DMA off to the SWIOTLB
bounce code.

But if that is broken, then that CVE is still not fixed?

So the issue here is that swiotlb_tbl_unmap_single(..,mapping_size,) is
under the attacker control. Ugh.

One way could be to have a io_tlb_orig_addr-ish array with the length
of mappings to double check?

Couple more questions:
 - Did you have already some PoC fixes for this? 
 - Is there a CVE associated with this?
 - Is there a paper on this you all are working on?

Thank you!
