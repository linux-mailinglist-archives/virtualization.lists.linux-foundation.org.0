Thanks for the explanation and I agree with your above description.
The data structure for credit is
per socket. But there is a subtle assumption for STREAM or connection
oriented communications. When the client sends the first connect message
to the server, it does not know the credit of the server. Current code
relies on the pkt_len == 0 to send it out, as the following:

/* virtio_transport_get_credit might return less than pkt_len credit */
pkt_len = virtio_transport_get_credit(vvs, pkt_len);

/* Do not send zero length OP_RW pkt */
if (pkt_len == 0 && info->op == VIRTIO_VSOCK_OP_RW)
return pkt_len;

DGRAM will be different. DGRAM does not require a
connect call, and the first message will have a non zero pkt_len.
We could somehow improve the current credit mechanism
and make it work for DGRAM too, but I don't think it is a strict
requirement for DGRAM.

Going back to the original question about why adding two more
new virtqueues, another reason is for better performance and
performance isolation. If DGRAM and STREAM share the same
queues, and both have heavy in-flight data, I think the throughput
of the STREAM will be decreased. Also, if the DGRAM server
somehow does not process packets for a long time, the packets
will be kept in the queue and also interfere with the STREAM
packets. I think adding two more queues without a credit
mechanism is the best option for DGRAM. If there are other
reasons to use credit or not adding two more queues, please
let me know. Thanks
