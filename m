I've been thinking about it. Imagine work stealing working perfectly.
Each time we xmit a packet, it is stolen and freed.
Since xmit enables callbacks (just in case!) we also
get an interrupt, which is automatically spurious.

My conclusion is that we shouldn't just work around it but instead
(or additionally?)
reduce the number of interrupts by disabling callbacks e.g. when
a. we are currently stealing packets
or
b. we stole all packets

This should be enough to reduce the chances below 99% ;)

One annoying thing is that with split and event index, we do not disable
interrupts. Could be worth revisiting, for now maybe just disable the
event index feature? I am not sure it is actually worth it with
stealing.
