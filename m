Hm I feel like drivers shouldn't need to know the difference here?

Like shmem helpers can track what's purgeable, and for eviction/purging
the driver callback should do the same?

The only difference is when we try to re-reserve the backing storage. When
the object has been evicted that should suceed, but when the object is
purged that will fail.

That's the difference between evict and purge for drivers?

It might be good to align this with ttm, otoh that all works quite a bit
differently for ttm since ttm supports buffer moves and a lot more fancy
stuff.

I'm bringing this up since I have this fancy idea that eventually we could
glue shmem helpers into ttm in some cases for managing buffers when they
sit in system memory (as opposed to vram).

This is a bit much midlayer. The way this works in ttm is you reserve all
the objects you need (which makes sure they're physically available
again), and then the driver goes through and makes sure the page tables
are all set up again.

Once you get towards gpu vm that's really the only approach, since your
swap_in has no idea for which vm it needs to restore pagetables (and
restoring it for all is a bit meh).

If drivers want to optimize this they can adjust/set any tracking
information from their evict callback as needed.

purgeable/purged needs some state, but pinned shouldn't be duplicated, so
I concur here a bit.

What are these disable counts for?

The way purgeable works in other drivers is that userspace sets purgeable
or not, and it's up to userspace to not make a mess of this.

There's also some interactions, and I guess a bunch of drivers get this
wrong in funny ways. Not sure how to best clean this up.

- Once you have a shrinker/dynamic memory management you should _not_ pin
  pages, except when it's truly permanent like for scanout. Instead
  drivers should attach dma_fence to the dma_resv to denote in-flight
  access.

- A pinned buffer object is not allowed to be put into purgeable state,
  and a bo in purgeable state should not be allowed to be pinned.

- Drivers need to hold dma_resv_lock for long enough in their command
  submission, i.e. from the point where the reserve the buffers and make
  sure that mappings exists, to the point where the request is submitted
  to hw or drm/sched and fences are installed.

But I think a lot of current shmem users just pin as part of execbuf, so
this won't work quite so well right out of the box.

Anyway with that design I don't think there should ever be a need to
disable shrinking.
