It seems like a huge assumption that every device is going to allow
this degree of specification in provisioning VFs.  mlx5 is a vendor
specific driver, it can make such assumptions in design philosophy.

What in the virtio or SR-IOV spec requires a vendor to make this

So nothing here is really "all in one place", it may be in the
provisioning of the VF, outside of the scope of the host OS, it might
be a collection of scripts or operators with device or interface
specific tooling to configure the device.  Sometimes this configuration
will be before the device is probed by the vfio-pci variant driver,
sometimes in between probing and opening the device.

I don't see why it becomes out of scope if the variant driver itself
provides some means for selecting a device profile.  We have evidence
both from mdev vGPUs and here (imo) that we can expect to see that
behavior, so why wouldn't we want to attempt some basic shared
interface for variant drivers to implement for selecting such a profile
rather than add to this hodgepodge

Isn't it then just like devlink, not a silver bullet, but useful for
some configuration?  AIUI, devlink shot down a means to list available
profiles for a device and a means to select one of those profiles.
There are a variety of attributes in sysfs which perform this sort of
behavior.  Specifying a specific profile in sysfs can be difficult, and
I'm not proposing sysfs profile support as a mandatory feature, but I'm
also not a fan of the vendor specific sysfs approach that out of tree
drivers have taken.

The mdev type interface is certainly not perfect, but from it we've
been able to develop mdevctl to allow persistent and complex
configurations of mdev devices.  I'd like to see the ability to do
something like that with variant drivers that offer multiple profiles
without always depending on vendor specific interfaces.  Thanks,

Alex
