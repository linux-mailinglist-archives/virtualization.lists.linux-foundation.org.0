Sure? This would mean that before spinlock-pvops are being set no lock
is allowed to be used in the kernel, because this would block the boot
time transition of the lock variant to use.

Another problem I'm seeing is that runtime pvops patching would rely on
the fact that stop_machine() isn't guarded by a spinlock.
