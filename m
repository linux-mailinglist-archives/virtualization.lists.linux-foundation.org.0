It would be too much work to harden them all, and it would be pointless 
because all these drivers are never legitimately needed in a virtualized 
environment which only virtualize a very small number of devices.

Everything that has had reasonable effort at hardening can be added. But 
if someone proposes to add a driver that should trigger additional 
scrutiny in code review. We should also request them to do some fuzzing.

It's a bit similar to someone trying to add a new syscall interface. 
That also triggers much additional scrutiny for good reasons and people 
start fuzzing it.

Adding something is submitting a patch to the allow list.

I'm not sure the "off" case would happen, unless the driver is 
completely removed, or maybe it has some unfixable security problem. But 
that is all rather unlikely.

How would user space know what drivers have been hardened? This is 
really something that the kernel needs to determine. I don't think we 
can outsource it to anyone else.

Also BTW of course user space can still override it, but really the 
defaults should be a kernel policy.

There's also the additional problem that one of the goals of 
confidential guest is to just move existing guest virtual images into 
them without much changes. So it's better for such a case if as much as 
possible of the policy is in the kernel. But that's more a secondary 
consideration, the first point is really the important part.
