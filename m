Hi, I add some performance statistics below.

Yes, the performance of dax can be limited when the DAX window is
limited, where dax window may be contended by multiple files.

I tested kernel compiling in virtiofs, emulating the scenario where a
lot of files contending dax window and triggering dax window reclaiming.

Environment setup:
- guest vCPU: 16
- time make vmlinux -j128

type    | cache  | cache-size | time
------- | ------ | ---------- | ----
non-dax | always |   --       | real 2m48.119s
dax     | always | 64M        | real 4m49.563s
dax     | always |   1G       | real 3m14.200s
dax     | always |   4G       | real 2m41.141s


It can be seen that there's performance drop, comparing to the normal
buffered IO, when dax window resource is restricted and dax window
relcaiming is triggered. The smaller the cache size is, the worse the
performance is. The performance drop can be alleviated and eliminated as
cache size increases.

Though we may not compile kernel in virtiofs, indeed we may access a lot
of small files in virtiofs and suffer this performance drop.


> In that case probaly we should just make DAX window larger. I assume

Yes, as the DAX window gets larger, it is less likely that we can run
short of dax window resource.

However it doesn't come without cost. 'struct page' descriptor for dax
window will consume guest memory at a ratio of ~1.5% (64/4096 = ~1.5%,
page descriptor is of 64 bytes size, assuming 4K sized page). That is,
every 1GB cache size will cost 16MB guest memory. As the cache size
increases, the memory footprint for page descriptors also increases,
which may offset the benefit of dax by eliminating guest page cache.

In summary, per-file dax feature tries to achieve a balance between
performance and memory overhead, by offering a finer gained control for
dax to users.

Currently we enable dax for hot and large blob files, while disabling
dax for other miscellaneous small files.
