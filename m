Thank you for your work on this, this is very interesting.

I'm not sure what you mean with this ?  Currently deferred-takeover is
handled in the fbcon code. Current flickerfree boot works like this
(assuming a single LCD panel in a laptop):

1. EFI/GOP sets up the framebuffer, draws a vendor logo
2. The bootloader runs in silent mode and does not touch anything gfx related
3. kernel boots, with a loglevel of 3 so only CRIT/EMERG messages are shown
2. efifb loads; and tells fbcon that a framebuffer is now available for it to "bind"
   to. Since CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_DEFERRED_TAKEOVER=y fbcon defers taking over
   the console and leaves the dummy-console driver in place (unless there have already
   been kernel messages logged, which there shouldn't because loglevel=3)
3. i915 loads, reads out the hw state compares this to the preferred-mode for the
   panel which it would set, they match, nothing happens. i915 takes ownership
   of the scanout-buffer set up by the GOP, but leaves it in place.
   i915 also removes the efifb /dev/fb0 and installs its own /dev/fb0 fbdev compat
   device, fbcon is notified of this, but is still deferred and leaves the dummy
   console driver in place as console driver.
4. Plymouth loads, allocates a new scan-out buffer at the panel's preferred resolution,
   plymouth reads the vendor-logo through the BGRT ACPI interface and fills the
   scanout-buffer with the vendor-logo + a spinner. Then plymouth installs the new
   scanout-buffer on the crtc, this is done atomically during vsync, so the user
   sees no changes, other then the spinner appearing
   (note the active VT is now in graphical mode)
5. From here on not flickering is a userspace problem

AFAICT this should work fine with simplekms too, unless it clears the screen
to black when it binds.

An addition to the above sequence, if at any time either the kernel or userspace
prints a message to the console; and at that time a fbdev is registered then fbcon
will takeover as the console driver from the dummy driver and it will start drawing
to the registered fbdev (1), destroying the framebuffer contents. Also if any messages
where printend while no fbdev was registered, then fbcon will takeover the console
as soon as a fbdev gets registered.

So since we already have deferred-takeover in the fbcon code, I wonder what you
mean when you are talking about "provide deferred takeover" for simplekms?

Regards,

Hans


1) Except when the VT has been switched to GFX mode when this happens, then fbcon
will delay using the fbdev until the VT is switched back to text mode.


p.s.

This has the interesting side effect then when logging into a desktop GUI session:
kernel -> plymouth -> gdm -> GNOME user session

There never is any output to the text-console and fbcon never takes-over, so on
many Laptops running say Fedora workstation the fbcon code is actually unused
until the user manually switches to another virtual-console to log in in
text-mode:

[hans@x1 ~]$ dmesg | grep -E 'fbcon|Console:|Truecolor'
[    0.258904] Console: colour dummy device 80x25

[    2.540894] fbcon: i915drmfb (fb0) is primary device

[hans@x1 ~]$ uptime
 12:29:39 up  4:19,  1 user,  load average: 0.58, 0.75, 0.81

Look mom no fbcon
