Actually, I configured the DAX window to 8MB, i.e. 4 slots when running
xfstests. Thus I think the reclaim path is most likely triggered.

Yeah, my colleague had ever reported that a DAX window of 4KB will cause
hang in our internal OS (which is 4.19, we back ported virtiofs to
4.19). But then I found that this issue doesn't exist in the latest
upstream. The reason seems that in the upstream kernel,
devm_memremap_pages() called in virtio_fs_setup_dax() will fail directly
since the dax window (4KB) is not aligned with the sparse memory section.
