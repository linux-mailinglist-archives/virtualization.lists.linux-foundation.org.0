That would be quite complicated and intrusive. In fact I'm not even sure 
how to do maintain something like this. There are a lot of needed 
initcalls, they would all need to be marked. How can we distinguish 
them? It would be a giant auditing project. And of course how would you 
prevent it from bitrotting?


Basically it would be hundreds of changes all over the tree, just to 
avoid two changes in virtio and MSI. Approach of just stopping the 
initcalls from doing bad things is much less intrusive.

See above.


Also the problem isn't really with modules (we rely on udev not loading 
them), but with builtin initcalls

Hmm, yes that's true. I guess we can make it default to opt-in for 
pci_iomap.

It only really matters for device less ioremaps.

Just allow listing the ioremaps is not self declaration because the 
device will still not initialize due to the central device filter. If 
you want to use it that has to be changed.

It's just an additional safety net to contain code running before probe.


>
> Or are you just trying to disable anything that runs before probe?


Well anything that could do dangerous host interactions (like processing 
ioremap data) A lot of things are harmless and can be allowed, or 
already blocked elsewhere (e.g. we have a IO port filter). This just 
handles the ioremap/MMIO case.

That won't stop initcalls.
