It's not just PCI driver, it's every driver that can do io port / MMIO / 
MSR / config space accesses.


Maybe read the excellent article from Jon on this:

For example if you look over old SCSI drivers in drivers/scsi/*.c there 
is a substantial number that has a module init longer than just 
registering a driver. As a single example look at drivers/scsi/BusLogic.c

There were also quite a few platform drivers like this.

The pci devices are enumerated in a standard way, but typically the 
driver also needs something else outside PCI that needs some other 
probing mechanism.

I thought we had already established this last time we discussed it.

That's completely impractical. We cannot harden thousands of drivers, 
especially since it would be all wasted work since nobody will ever need 
them in virtual guests. Even if we could harden them how would such a 
work be maintained long term? Using a firewall and filtering mechanism 
is much saner for everyone.
