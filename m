If your chunk starts at address X in the umem and you want 128 bytes of headroom, just write your packet into X+128 and put that address into the Tx descriptor. Will this solve your problem? If not, what would you need from AF_XDP to make it work?

The driver of virtio net, when passing the packet to the hardware, should add a
virtnet hdr (12 bytes) in front of the packet. Both rx and tx should add such a
header. AF_XDP has a space of 256 bytes in the rx process. We can reuse this
space. The direction of AF_XDP tx has no such regulation.

The method you mentioned requires user cooperation, which is not a good method
for driver implementation.
