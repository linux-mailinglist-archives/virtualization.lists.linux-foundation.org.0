Any unprivileged user can check into this field to know parent device's capability without having to create a child vDPA device at all. The features that child vDPA device may support should be a subset of, or at most up to what the parent device offers. For e.g. the vdpa device dev1 you created below can expose less or equal device_features bit than 0x308820028 (MTU MAC CTRL_VQ CTRL_MAC_ADDR ANY_LAYOUT VERSION_1 ACCESS_PLATFORM), but shouldn't be no more than what the parent device can actually support.
> Yes, I didn't see anything wrong with "dev_features",
Yep, it didn't appear to me anything wrong either at first sight, then I 
gave my R-b on the series introduced this attribute. But it's not a 
perfect name, either, on the other hand. Parav later pointed out that 
the corresponding enum definition for this attribute should follow 
pre-existing naming convention that we should perhaps do 
s/VDPA_ATTR_DEV_SUPPORTED_FEATURES/VDPA_ATTR_MGMTDEV_SUPPORTED_FEATURES/ 
to get it renamed, as this is a mgmtdev level attribute, which I agree. 
Now that with the upcoming "device_features" attribute (vdpa dev level) 
from this series, it's subject to another confusions between these two 
similar names, but actually would represent things at different level. 
While all other attributes in "mgmtdev dev show" seem to be aligned with 
the "supported_" prefix, e.g. supported_classes, max_supported_vqs, from 
which I think the stance of device is already implied through "mgmtdev" 
in the command. For the perspective of clarify and easy distinction, 
"supported_features" seems to be a better name than "dev_features".

Never mind, if it's late don't have to bother.

That's true, I think I ever pointed it out to Lingshan before, that it's 
not needed to bother exposing those config space fields in "dev config 
show" output, if the only intent is for live migration of device 
features between nodes. For vDPA live migration, what cares most is 
those configuration parameters specified on vdpa creation, and userspace 
VMM (QEMU) is supposed to take care of saving and restoring live device 
states. I think it's easier to extend "vdpa dev show" output to include 
device_features and other config params as well, rather than count on 
validity of various config space fields.

https://lore.kernel.org/virtualization/454bdf1b-daa1-aa67-2b8c-bc15351c1851@oracle.com/

It's not just insufficient, but sometimes is incorrect to create vDPA 
device using the config space fields.  For instance, MAC address in 
config space can be changed temporarily (until device reset) via ctrl_vq 
VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_MAC_ADDR_SET command. It's incorrect to create vDPA 
using the MAC address shown in the config space.  Another example, if 
the source vDPA device has MAC address table size limit of 100, then in 
the destination we should pick parent device with size limit no smaller 
than that, and create vDPA on remote node matching the exact same size. 
There's nothing config space field can assist here.

One example further, in the future, if we are going to introduce 
mandatory feature (for e.g. VERSION_1, RING_PACKED) that the device is 
unable to support the opposite case, the destination device should be 
created with equally same mandatory device features, which only vDPA 
creation parameters should matter. While I can't think of a case that 
the mgmt software or live migration tool would have to count on config 
space fields only.

Before this change, only look at the dev_features in "mgmtdev show" and 
remember creation parameters is sufficient to get to all needed info for 
creating vDPA at destination. After this change, dev_features in 
"mgmtdev show" becomes less relevant, as it would need to remember vdpa 
creation parameters plus the device_features attribute. While this 
series allows cross vendor live migration, it would complicate the 
implementation of mgmt software, on the other hand.

That was how it's supposed to work previously, but with this series, I 
think the newly introduced device_features will be needed instead of the 
one in "mgmtdev show".

If the device_features vDPA created with at the source doesn't include 
CTRL_MAC_ADDR even though parent supports it, then the vDPA to be 
created at the destination shouldn't come with CTRL_MAC_ADDR either, 
regardless of whether or not CTRL_MAC_ADDR is present in destination 
"mgmtdev show".

However, if just taking look at negotiated_features, some mgmt software 
implementations which don't persist the creation parameters can't get 
the device features a certain vDPA device at the source node was created 
with.

For e.g. for cpu flags, mgmt software can infer the guest cpus features in use from all qemu command line arguments and host cpu features/capability, which doesn't need to remember creation arguments and is easy to recover from failure without having to make the VM config persistent in data store. I thought it would be great if vdpa CLI design could offer the same.

What you refer to is the so-called named model for CPU flags. I think 
it's a good addition to have some generation or named model defined for 
vDPA. But I don't get the point for how it relates to exposing the 
actual value of device features? Are you saying in this case you'd 
rather expose the model name than the actual value of feature bits? 
Well, I think we can expose both in different fields when there's really 
such a need.

BTW with regard to the cpu model in mgmt software implementation, the 
one implemented in libvirt is a mixed "Host model" [1] with taking 
advantage of QEMU named model and exposing additional individual CPU 
features that gets close to what host CPU offers. I think this implies 
that mgmt software should have to understand what the model name really 
means in terms of individual CPU features, so having feature bit value 
exposed will just do more help if vDPA goes the same way.

When simply look at the &quot;vdpa dev config show&quot; output, I cannot really
tell the actual device_features that was used in vdpa creation. For e.g.
there is a missing feature ANY_LAYOUT from negotiated_features compared
with supported_features in mgmtdev, but the orchestration software
couldn't tell if the vdpa device on destination host should be created
with or without the ANY_LAYOUT feature.

I think VERSION_1 implies ANY_LAYOUT.

Right, ANY_LAYOUT is a bad example. A good example might be that, I knew the parent mgmtdev on migration source node supports CTRL_MAC_ADDR, but I don't find it in negotiated_features.

I think we should use the features that we got from &quot;mgmtdev show&quot;
instead of &quot;negotiated features&quot;.</pre>

    That was how it's supposed to work previously, but with this series,
    I think the newly introduced device_features will be needed instead
    of the one in &quot;mgmtdev show&quot;.<br>

So in this example, we need use &quot;dev_features&quot; so we get exact the

    If the device_features vDPA created with at the source doesn't
    include CTRL_MAC_ADDR even though parent supports it, then the vDPA
    to be created at the destination shouldn't come with CTRL_MAC_ADDR
    either, regardless of whether or not CTRL_MAC_ADDR is present in
    destination &quot;mgmtdev show&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    However, if just taking look at negotiated_features, some mgmt
    software implementations which don't persist the creation parameters
    can't get the device features a certain vDPA device at the source
    node was created with. <br>

 But it should be sufficient to
use features_src &amp; feature_dst in this case. Actually, it should work
similar as to the cpu flags, the management software should introduce
the concept of cluster which means the maximal set of common features
is calculated and provisioned during device creation to allow
migration among the nodes inside the cluster.

Yes, this is one way mgmt software may implement, but I am not sure if it's the only way. For e.g. for cpu flags, mgmt software can infer the guest cpus features in use from all qemu command line arguments and host cpu features/capability, which doesn't need to remember creation arguments and is easy to recover from failure without having to make the VM config persistent in data store. I thought it would be great if vdpa CLI design could offer the same.

      <pre class="moz-quote-pre" wrap="">
One minor difference is that we have cpu model abstraction, so we can
have things like:

./qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu EPYC

Which implies the cpu features/flags where vDPA doesn't have. But
consider it's just a 64bit (or 128 in the future), it doesn't seems to
be too complex for the management to know, we probably need to start
from this and then we can try to introduce some generation/model after
it is agreed on most of the vendors.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    What you refer to is the so-called named model for CPU flags. I
    think it's a good addition to have some generation or named model
    defined for vDPA. But I don't get the point for how it relates to
    exposing the actual value of device features? Are you saying in this
    case you'd rather expose the model name than the actual value of
    feature bits? Well, I think we can expose both in different fields
    when there's really such a need.<br>
    <br>
    BTW with regard to the cpu model in mgmt software implementation,
    the one implemented in libvirt is a mixed &quot;Host model&quot; [1] with
    taking advantage of QEMU named model and exposing additional
    individual CPU features that gets close to what host CPU offers. I
    think this implies that mgmt software should have to understand what
    the model name really means in terms of individual CPU features, so
    having feature bit value exposed will just do more help if vDPA goes
    the same way.<br>
