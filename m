vfio-amba with the pl330 on Juno, perhaps?

It should do, since the downstream DT says the SMMU is non-coherent.

I think that's a good idea, but IIRC Jason mentioned in review of the 
VFIO series that it's not sufficient to provide the actual guarantee 
we're after, since there are out-of-spec devices that ignore the control 
and may send no-snoop packets anyway. However, as part of a best-effort 
approach for arm64 it still makes sense to help all the well-behaved 
drivers/devices do the right thing.

Cheers,
Robin.
