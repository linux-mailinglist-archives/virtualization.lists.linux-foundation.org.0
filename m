This API is intended to be driver- or bus-level. I don't think
subsystems can do very much since they don't know the hardware
capabilities (cheap interrupt disabling) and in most cases there's no
advantage of plumbing it through subsystems when drivers can call the
API directly.

Why? Maybe because the cpuidle execution environment is a little special?

Yes.

My understand is NAPI always takes the first interrupt. Polling only
happens on subsequent rounds until there's no more work to do.

There seem to be multiple factors that would influence tx performance
like how full the tx queues are, whether more packets are sent during
NAPI polling, whether you're benchmarking a physical PCIe NIC or a
vhost_net software device, etc.

Regarding APICV and software devices, the benchmark results I posted
show that avoiding the interrupt injection helps even with APICV.
