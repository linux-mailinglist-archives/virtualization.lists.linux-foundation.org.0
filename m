Oh, this would be great!

Okay, I see, but how this is propagate to the userspace?

IIUC for UDP the user should open a RAW socket with IPPROTO_ICMP and 
wait for an error message.

Have you taken a look at a possible implementation with AF_VSOCK yet?

In any case if it can be useful we could include it in the spec and then 
implement it later in Linux.

Thanks,
Stefano
