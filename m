I think that the 'classic header' can stay as is, and the extended =

header can be dynamically allocated, as we do for the payload.

But we have to be careful what happens if the other peer doesn't support =

SEQPACKET and if it counts this extra header as a payload for the credit =

mechanism.

I'll try to take a closer look in the next few days.

Thanks,
Stefano
