I don't see any point in talking about "untrusted drivers".  If a 
driver isn't trusted then it doesn't belong in your kernel.  Period.  
When you load a driver into your kernel, you are implicitly trusting 
it (aside from limitations imposed by security modules).  The code 
it contains, the module_init code in particular, runs with full 
superuser permissions.

What use is there in loading a driver but telling the kernel "I don't 
trust this driver, so don't allow it to probe any devices"?  Why not 
just blacklist it so that it never gets modprobed in the first place?
