If this is the standard we're going to follow, ie. profiling of a
device is expected to occur prior to the probe of the vfio-pci variant
driver, then we should get the out-of-tree NVIDIA vGPU driver on board
with this too.

It's not super important, it's just overly broad vs what's actually
implemented.  Limiting the description to virtio-net for the current
implementation is fine.

> Once I'll have the above feedback I may prepare and send V2.

I'll try to take a more thorough look, but also note my comments to
Ankit relative to config space emulation.  This driver correctly
implements the flags for the IO Port BAR, but does not support sizing
of the BAR through config space, which I think is a shortcoming
relative to that implemented by vfio-pci.  QEMU doesn't rely on this,
but we don't know there aren't other userspaces that depend on this
behavior.  Thanks,

Alex
