Well, for pci I think the driver knows that it is using either legacy or
modern, no?

And for ccw, the driver knows at that point in time which revision it
negotiated, so it should know that a revision > 0 will use LE (and the
device will obviously know that as well.)

Or am I misunderstanding what you're getting at?
