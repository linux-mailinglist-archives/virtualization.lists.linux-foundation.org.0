I am not sure. I think Linux kernel should be fine with what you described.
But I am not sure about QEMU. From the code, I see virtqueue is allocated
as an array, like following,

+ #ifdef CONFIG_VHOST_VSOCK_DGRAM
+    struct vhost_virtqueue vhost_vqs[4];
+ #else
    struct vhost_virtqueue vhost_vqs[2];
+ #endi

so I assume the virtqueues for tx/rx should be
continuous? I can try to put the new queues at the end and see if it
works or not.

btw, my qemu change is here:

No specific reason. Any recommendations?

This is only when mergeable rxbuf bit is used. I think before this, the stream
rx buf should be at least bigger than the pkt header. We just did not put that
into the spec.

Sure. I see both past tense and present tense in the spec, so I was a little bit
