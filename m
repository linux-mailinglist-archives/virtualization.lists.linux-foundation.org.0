 the Conference. This poster must follow an A1 or A2 vertical format. =
The Conference includes Work Sessions where these posters are presente=
d and orally discussed, with a 7 minute limit per poster.

The authors of accepted Full papers will have 15 minutes to present th=
eir work in a Conference Work Session; approximately 5 minutes of disc=
ussion will follow each presentation. The authors of accepted Short pa=
pers and Company papers will have 11 minutes to present their work in =
a Conference Work Session; approximately 4 minutes of discussion will =
follow each presentation.

 poster paper or company paper is presented, at least one of the autho=
rs must be fully registered by the 4th of January 2024, and the paper =
