Yes, this is the starting point of this patch set.

If guest queries if the file is DAX capable or not by an extra GETATTR,
I'm afraid this will add extra round trip.

Or if we add the DAX flag (ATTR_DAX) by extending LOOKUP, as done by
this patch set, then the FUSE server needs to set ATTR_DAX according to
the FS_XFLAG_DAX of the backend files, *to make the FS_XFLAG_DAX flag
previously set by FUSE client work*. Then it becomes a *mandatory*
requirement when implementing FUSE server. i.e., it becomes part of the
FUSE protocol rather than implementation specific. FUSE server can still
implement some other algorithm deciding whether to set ATTR_DAX or not,
though it must set ATTR_DAX once the backend file is flagged with
FS_XFLAG_DAX.

Besides, as you said, FUSE server needs to add one extra
GETFLAGS/FSGETXATTR ioctl per LOOKUP in this case. To eliminate this
cost, we could negotiate the per-file DAX capability during FUSE_INIT.
Only when the per-file DAX capability is negotiated, will the FUSE
server do extra GETFLAGS/FSGETXATTR ioctl and set ATTR_DAX flag when
doing LOOKUP.


Personally, I prefer the second way, i.e., by extending LOOKUP (adding
ATTR_DAX), to eliminate the extra round trip.

As I said previously, it can be negotiated whether this per-file DAX
capability is needed. Guest can advertise this capability when '-o
dax=inode' is configured.
