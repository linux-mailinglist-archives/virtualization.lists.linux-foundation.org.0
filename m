Yup, vram or similar special ram is the reason why an importer can't look
at the pages behind a dma-buf sg table.

Yup, this needs to flow the other way round than in these patches.

Yeah that sounds like a useful addition.

Also, the same flow should work for real gpus passed through as pci
devices. What we need is some way to surface the dma-buf on the guest
side, which I think doesn't exist yet stand-alone. But this role could be
fulfilled by virtio-gpu in render-only mode I think. And (assuming I've
understood the recent discussions around virtio dma-buf sharing using
virtio ids) this would give you some neat zero-copy tricks for free if you
share multiple devices.

Also if you really want seamless buffer sharing between devices that are
passed to the guest and devices on the host side (like displays I guess?
or maybe video encode if this is for cloug gaming?), then using virtio-gpu
in render mode should also allow you to pass the dma_fence back&forth.
Which we'll need too, not just the dma-buf.

So at a first guess I'd say "render-only virtio-gpu mode" sounds like
something rather useful. But I might be totally off here.

Cheers, Daniel
