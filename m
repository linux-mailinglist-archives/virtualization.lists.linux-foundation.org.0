No, if I understand Michael correctly he has suggested a different approach.

My suggestion was that the kernel continues to manage the worker
threads but an ioctl allows userspace to control the policy.

I think Michael is saying that the kernel shouldn't manage/create
threads. Userspace should create threads and then invoke an ioctl from
those threads.

The ioctl will call into the vhost driver where it will execute
something similar to vhost_worker(). So this ioctl will block while
the kernel is using the thread to process vqs.

What isn't clear to me is how to tell the kernel which vqs are
processed by a thread. We could try to pass that information into the
ioctl. I'm not sure what the cleanest solution is here.

Maybe something like:

struct vhost_run_worker_info {
    struct timespec *timeout;
    sigset_t *sigmask;

    /* List of virtqueues to process */
    unsigned nvqs;
    unsigned vqs[];
};

/* This blocks until the timeout is reached, a signal is received, or
the vhost device is destroyed */
int ret = ioctl(vhost_fd, VHOST_RUN_WORKER, &info);

As you can see, userspace isn't involved with dealing with the
requests. It just acts as a thread donor to the vhost driver.

We would want the VHOST_RUN_WORKER calls to be infrequent to avoid the
penalty of switching into the kernel, copying in the arguments, etc.

Michael: is this the kind of thing you were thinking of?

Stefan
