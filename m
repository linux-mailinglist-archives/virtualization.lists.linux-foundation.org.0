I just updated memory-hotplug.rst exactly for that purpose :)

https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20210525102604.8770-1-david@redhat.com

There, also safe zone ratios and "usually well known values" are given. 
I can link it in the next cover letter.

It's a bit more complicated. Each individual unit (e.g., a 128 MiB 
memory block) is the smallest granularity we can add/remove of that 
device. So such a unit is somewhat like a DIMM. However, all "units" of 
the device can interact -- it's a single memory device.

Well, with auto-onlining in the kernel disabled, user space has to do 
the onlining -- for example via udev rules right now in major distributions.

But there are also users that always want to online manually in user 
space to select a zone. Most prominently standby memory on s390x, but 
also in some cases dax/kmem memory. But these two are really corner 
cases. In general, we want hotplugged memory to be onlined immediately.

Again, currently resides in the memory-hotplug.rst overhaul.

Right, the relevant patch contains more info.

You either plug or unplug a DIMM (or a NUMA node which spans multiple 
DIMMS) -- both are ACPI memory devices that span multiple physical 
regions. You cannot unplug parts of a DIMM or grow it. "static" as also 
expressed by ACPI code ("adds" and "removes" all memory device memory in 
one go).

virtio-mem behaves differently, as it's a single physical memory region 
in which we dynamically add or remove memory. The granularity in which 
we add/remove memory from Linux is a "unit". In the simplest case, it's 
just a single memory block (e.g., 128 MiB). So it's a memory device that 
can grow/shrink in the given unit -- "dynamic".

The virtio-mem example below should make this a bit more clearer (in 
addition to the relevant patch), especially in contrast to static memory 
devices like DIMMs. Key is that a single virtio-mem device is a "dynamic 
memory group" in which memory can get added/removed dynamically in a 
given unit granularity. And we want to special case that type of device 
to have as much memory of a virtio-mem device being MOVABLE as possible 
(and configured).

Yes, as mentioned below, an memory-hotplug.rst update will follow once 
the overhaul is done. The respective patch contains more information.

Sorry, it's actually "Memory block 0-15", which gives us 0-15 and 32-47 
== 32 memory blocks corresponding to boot memory. Note that the absent 
memory blocks 16-31 should correspond to the PCI hole.
