Yes, in the original patch it is called VHOST_F_DEVICE_IOTLB actually
to make it differ from virtio like VHOST_F_LOG_ALL etc. And I remember
I tried to post patch to avoid the bit duplication but the conclusion
is that it's too late for the changes.

I think this breaks the security assumptions of some setups.

Yes.

+1

Thanks
