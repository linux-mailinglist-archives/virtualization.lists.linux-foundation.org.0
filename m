I guess. OK we can make it MUST.

Both versions are actually confused, since how do you
find out that device does not offer VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1?

I think what this should really say is

Transitional drivers MUST NOT accept VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 through
the legacy interface.


Does linux actually satisfy this? Will it accept VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1
through the legacy interface if offered?

Do we want to also add explanation that features can be
changed until FEATURES_OK?
