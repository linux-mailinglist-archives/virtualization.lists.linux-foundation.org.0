It should also allow us to save the header for each fragment.

@Jiang Do you want to explore this?
I'm talking about VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF feature.

Yep I see, and they would often be mostly unused...

I was thinking that UDP at most can support 64K messages that IP should 
fragment according to MTU.
