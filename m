The code below does nothing for exec.

You really need to call get_signal to handle SIGSTOP/freeze/process exit.

A variant on my coredump proposal looks like it can handle exec as well.
It isn't pretty but it looks good enough for right now.

If you could test the patch I posted up thread I think that is something
imperfect that is good enough for now.
