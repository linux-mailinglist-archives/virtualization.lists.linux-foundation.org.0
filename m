Well this was not the design. This is the main change:


@@ -739,7 +742,10 @@ static void virtqueue_disable_cb_split(struct virtqueue *_vq)

        if (!(vq->split.avail_flags_shadow & VRING_AVAIL_F_NO_INTERRUPT)) {
                vq->split.avail_flags_shadow |= VRING_AVAIL_F_NO_INTERRUPT;
-               if (!vq->event)
+               if (vq->event)
+                       /* TODO: this is a hack. Figure out a cleaner value to write. */
+                       vring_used_event(&vq->split.vring) = 0x0;
+               else
                        vq->split.vring.avail->flags =
                                cpu_to_virtio16(_vq->vdev,
                                                vq->split.avail_flags_shadow);


IIUC previously when event index was enabled (vq->event) virtqueue_disable_cb_split
was a nop. Now it sets index to 0x0 (which is a hack, but good enough
for testing I think).

It's the same for the pci transport.
