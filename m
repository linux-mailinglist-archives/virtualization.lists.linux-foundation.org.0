Well I did look at what the text said, not the details in the formatting...

I still think that would be nicer while using some quotation marks, even
if you are just doing a partial quote.

In the first paragraph, however, we really should mark the quote

Sounds good to me.

No strong opinion here. Anyone else?

Ok, let's use that without the trailing BE.

No further comments other than what I wrote above, but maybe others have
