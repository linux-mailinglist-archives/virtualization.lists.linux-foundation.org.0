Agreed. This might prove a significant performance gain at the same time :)

The earlier the better. I see no benefit to delay until the rx handler
actually runs.

With event index, we suppress interrupts when another interrupt is
already pending from a previous packet, right? When the previous
position of the producer is already beyond the consumer. It doesn't
matter whether the previous packet triggered a tx interrupt or
deferred to an already scheduled rx interrupt? From that seems fine to
leave it out.
