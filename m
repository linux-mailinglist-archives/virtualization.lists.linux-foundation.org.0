Yes that's the contract for unbind() at the moment

Oh that's interesting, I didn't know about the implicit TLB invalidations
on page requests for VT-d.

For Arm SMMU, clearing the PASID table entry does cause ATS Translation
Requests to return with Completer Abort, but does not affect PRI. The SMMU
pushes page requests directly into the PRI queue without reading any table
(unless the queue overflows).

We're counting on the device driver to perform the PASID stop request
before calling unbind(), described in PCIe 6.20.1 (Managing PASID Usage)
and 10.4.1.2 (Managing PASID Usage on PRG Requests). This ensures that
when unbind() is called, no more page request for the PASID is pushed into
the PRI queue. But some may still be in the queue if the device uses stop
markers.

This is what I'm concerned about. For VT-d this happens in the host which
is in charge of modifying the PASID table. For SMMU, the guest writes the
PASID table. It flushes its virtual PRI queue, but not the physical queue
that is managed by the host.

One synchronization point where the host could flush the physical PRI
queue is the PASID config invalidation (CMD_CFGI_CD). As Jason pointed out
the host may not be able to observe those if a command queue is assigned
directly to the guest (a theoretical SMMU extension), though in that case
the guest may also have direct access to a PRI queue (like the AMD vIOMMU
extension) and be able to flush the queue directly.

But we can just wait for PRI implementations and see what the drivers
need. Maybe no device will implement stop markers.

Thanks,
Jean
