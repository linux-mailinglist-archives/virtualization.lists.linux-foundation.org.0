These all shouldn't matter for a confidential guest. The only way it can 
be attacked is through IO, everything else is protected by hardware.


Also it would all require doing something at the guest level, which we 
assume is not malicious.

That's expected to be handled by authenticated dmcrypt and similar. 
Hardening at this level has been done for many years.

Networking should be already hardened, otherwise you would have much 
worse problems today.

This is handled by the central allow list. We intentionally didn't want 
each driver to declare itself, but have a central list where changes 
will get more scrutiny than random driver code.

But then there are the additional opt-ins for the low level firewall. 
These are in the API. I don't see how it could be done at the driver 
level, unless you want to pass in a struct device everywhere?

We're addressing most of them with the device filter for platform 
drivers. But since we cannot stop them doing ioremap IO in their init 
code they also need the low level firewall.

Some others that cannot be addressed have explicit disables.


> So make them configurable?

Why not just fix the runtime? It's much saner for everyone. Proposing to 
do things at build time sounds like we're in Linux 0.99 days.
