That means the backend fs must be ext4/xfs supporting per-file DAX feature.

If given more right to construct its own policy, FUSE server could
support per-file DAX upon other backend fs, though it will always fail
when virtiofs wants to set FS_XFLAG_DAX inside guest.

In our use case, the backend fs is something like SquashFS on host. The
content of the file on host is downloaded *as needed*. When the file is
not completely ready (completely downloaded), the guest will follow the
normal IO routine, i.e., by FUSE_READ/FUSE_WRITE request. While the file
is completely ready, per-file DAX is enabled for this file. IOW the FUSE
server need to dynamically decide if per-file DAX shall be enabled,
depending on if the file is completely downloaded.

Our strategy and design is still under discussion and may change. Any
comment and discussion is welcomed.
