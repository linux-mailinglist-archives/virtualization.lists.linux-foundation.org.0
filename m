Hi Eric,

But on those there is device-tree, right?

The other x86 IOMMUs are PCI devices too and they definitly need a ACPI
table to be configured.

An integration with IORT might be the best, but if it is not possible
ther can be a new table-type for Virtio-iommu. That would still follow
platform best practices.

Yeah, if I am reading that right this proposes a one-fits-all solution.
That is not needed as the other x86 IOMMUs already have their tables
defined and implemented. There is no need to change anything there.

It is a hack and should be avoided if at all possible. And defining an
own ACPI table type seems very much possible.
