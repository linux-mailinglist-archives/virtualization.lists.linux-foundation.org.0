Looked and I don't see it yet. Let's consider
./net/vmw_vsock/virtio_transport.c for example. Assuming we block
callbacks until the first kick, what is the issue with probe exactly?

I don't see what does driver_ok have to do with it.

So if drivers kick but are not ready to get callbacks then let's fix
that first of all, these are racy with existing qemu even ignoring
spec compliance.
