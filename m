Yes, resurrecting a handful of poisoned pages does not help 
significantly. And, in some ways, it seems nice to have. :D

A VM uses RAM of 2M huge page. Once a MCE(@HVAy in [HVAx,HVAz)) occurs, 
the 2M([HVAx,HVAz)) of hypervisor becomes unaccessible, but the guest 
poisons 4K (@GPAy in [GPAx, GPAz)) only, it may hit another 511 MCE 
([GPAx, GPAz) except GPAy). This is the worse case, so I want to add
  '__le32 corrupted_pages' in struct virtio_balloon_config, it is used 
in the next step: reporting 512 * 4K 'corrupted_pages' to the guest, the 
guest has a chance to isolate the other 511 pages ahead of time. And the 
guest actually loses 2M, fixing 512*4K seems to help significantly.

The CE storm leads 2 problems I have even seen:
1, the memory bandwidth slows down to 10%~20%, and the cycles per 
instruction of CPU increases a lot.
2, the THR (/proc/interrupts) interrupts frequently, the CPU has to use 
a lot time to handle IRQ.

But no corrupted page occurs. Migrating VM to another healthy host seems 
a good choice. This patch does not handle CE storm case.
