Staring at QEMU: the queues are added when the virtio-balloon device is
*created*. Queues are added based on feature configuration, if they are
part of the device feature set.

That should translate to "is advertised", not "is negotiated".

The queue ordering is as follows:

* inflate queue, baseline device
* deflate queue, baseline device
* driver memory statistics, VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_STATS_VQ
* free page hinting, VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_FREE_PAGE_HINT
* free page reporting, VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_REPORTING

QEMU always supports the first 3, so they use number 0-2. The other two
can be configured for the device.

So the queue indices vary based on actual feature presence.

Yes, that's my understanding.

And that does not seem to be the case. At least QEMU assigns them sequentially,
based on actually configured features for the device.

If I read the kernel code correctly (drivers/virtio/virtio_balloon.c:init_vqs)
it also behaves that way: if the device has a certain feature
"virtio_has_feature", it gets the next index. Otherwise, the next index goes
to another feature:

	/*
	 * Inflateq and deflateq are used unconditionally. The names[]
	 * will be NULL if the related feature is not enabled, which will
	 * cause no allocation for the corresponding virtqueue in find_vqs.
	 */
	callbacks[VIRTIO_BALLOON_VQ_INFLATE] = balloon_ack;
	names[VIRTIO_BALLOON_VQ_INFLATE] = "inflate";
	callbacks[VIRTIO_BALLOON_VQ_DEFLATE] = balloon_ack;
	names[VIRTIO_BALLOON_VQ_DEFLATE] = "deflate";

Then the specification really needs updating :)

Note that at the time of this commit, there was no support for "free page reporting".

         callbacks[VIRTIO_BALLOON_VQ_INFLATE] = balloon_ack;
         names[VIRTIO_BALLOON_VQ_INFLATE] = "inflate";
         callbacks[VIRTIO_BALLOON_VQ_DEFLATE] = balloon_ack;
         names[VIRTIO_BALLOON_VQ_DEFLATE] = "deflate";
         names[VIRTIO_BALLOON_VQ_STATS] = NULL;
         names[VIRTIO_BALLOON_VQ_FREE_PAGE] = NULL;

         if (virtio_has_feature(vb->vdev, VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_STATS_VQ)) {
                 names[VIRTIO_BALLOON_VQ_STATS] = "stats";
                 callbacks[VIRTIO_BALLOON_VQ_STATS] = stats_request;
         }

         if (virtio_has_feature(vb->vdev, VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_FREE_PAGE_HINT)) {
                 names[VIRTIO_BALLOON_VQ_FREE_PAGE] = "free_page_vq";
                 callbacks[VIRTIO_BALLOON_VQ_FREE_PAGE] = NULL;
         }

And as QEMU always sets VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_STATS_VQ, that one always gets id=2.

Consequently, VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_FREE_PAGE_HINT, if around, gets id=3.

As we didn't support VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_REPORTING, it doesn't matter which id it gets.

But as you note, once we have different implementations and more feature variability,
it's a mess.

A device that implements VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_FREE_PAGE_HINT but not VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_STATS_VQ
might not work correctly with either old or new QEMU.

Maybe it needs to be documented that any device that implements either
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_FREE_PAGE_HINT or VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_REPORTING *must* also implement
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_STATS_VQ, so old+new Linux drivers would continue working.

Changing drivers/devices is pretty much impossible.

So we should document the queue assignment better, and maybe the implication
of requiring VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_STATS_VQ when any new features are implemented.

Does that make sense?

I think you raised an important point. We should try documenting reality in
the specification.
