Well, I don't like throwing data away, so in that sense I do like
per-queue stats, but it's not a very strong preference (i.e., I can live
with either)...

... however if we do go with per-channel stats I do agree that they
shouldn't be in the default output. I guess netlink could still split
them out and iproute2 could just sum them before display?

I agree it would be nice to have a separate error counter, but a single
counter is enough when combined with the tracepoints.

A whole set of separate counters for XSK is certainly overkill. No
strong preference as to whether they need a separate counter at all...

I'm generally a fan of correctness first, so since you're touching all
the drivers anyway why I'd say go for u64_stats_t :)
