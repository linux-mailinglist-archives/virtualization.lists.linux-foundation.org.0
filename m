Agreed, that is why I said I don't think try_set_pending_sigkill() is
a good idea.

And again, the same is true for the threads created by
create_io_thread(). get_signal() from io_uring/ can dequeue a pending
SIGKILL and return, but that is all.

Sorry, I don't understand. I just tried to say that
sigaddset(&t->pending.signal, SIGKILL) really sets SIGKILL pending.
Nevermind.

I meant I never really liked how io-threads play with signals,

Cough. but this is ugly. Or I missed something.

Exactly,

Exactly.

OK. It doesn't matter. I tried to read the whole thread and got lost.

IIUC, Mike is going to send the next version? So I think we can delay
the further discussions until then.

Oleg.
