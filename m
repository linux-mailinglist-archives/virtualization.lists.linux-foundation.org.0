Yes, idea is that this is used by virtiofs. Now looks like there are
multiple implementations of virtiofs daemon and they are either not
using libfuse or have forked off libfuse or created a new libfuse
equivalent in rust etc. So as fuse kernel gets updated, people are
updating their corresponding code as need be.

For example, we have C version of virtiofsd in qemu. That has taken
code from libfuse and built on top of it. BTW, C version of virtiofsd
is deprecated now and not lot of new development is expected to take
place there.

Then there is rust version of virtiofsd where new development is taking
place and which is replacement of C virtiofsd.

https://gitlab.com/virtio-fs/virtiofsd

This does not use libfuse at all.

And I think other folks (like developers from Alibaba) have probably 
written their own implementation of virtiofsd. I am not sure what
exactly are they using.

I see there is rust crate for fuse.

https://crates.io/crates/fuse

And there is one in cloud-hypervisor project.

So server side of fuse seem to be all fragmented to me. People have
written their own implementations based on their needs.

Agreed. I worry about testing constantly as well. qemu version of
virtiofsd does not have DAX support yet. Rust version DAX support is
also minimal. 

So for testing DAX, I have to rely on out of tree patches from qemu
here if any changes in virtiofs client happen.

https://gitlab.com/virtio-fs/qemu/-/tree/virtio-fs-dev

Jeffle is probably relying on their own virtiofsd implementation for DAX
testing.

Thanks
Vivek
