I have a related question. How to determine the suitable size of a
fragment?  Unlike stream or seqpacket sockets, the datagram
sockets do not know the available recv buf of the listener. Eg.if the listener
free recv buf is 64KB, and the sender wants to send a 256KB packet, how
does the sender know what the fragment size is? One option is to
use some default  fragment size and try to send those fragments. But those
fragments could still be dropped by the receiver.

Yes, I agree that is a problem. In my mind, the accounting is
different from the credit mechanism used by the stream sockets.
The accounting is for the sender side only and the packets may
still be dropped at the receiving side if it is larger than the
available recv buf.
