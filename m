Unloading the driver will only remove exclusion if the driver can be 
unloaded cleanly -- if there is no memory added to Linux. Similar to 
force-unbinding dax/kmem without offlining memory, the whole device 
range will remain excluded.

(unloading the driver is only even implemented because there is no way 
to not implement it; there is no sane use case for virtio-mem to do that)

There are 2 things that are relevant for virtio-mem memory in regards of 
this series:

1. Kernel is currently using it (added virtio-mem memory). Don't allow 
access. Pretty much like most other things we want to exclude, I agree.

2. Kernel is currently not using it (not yet added virtio-mem memory), 
or not using it right now any more (removed virtio-mem memory). In 
contrast to other devices (DIMM, PMEM, ...) there is no sane use case 
for this memory, because the VM must not use it (as defined in the 
virtio-spec).


I care about 2) a lot because I don't want people looking at 
/proc/iomem, figuring out that there is something to map. And by the 
time they try to map it via /dev/mem, virtio-mem emoved that memory, yet 
a /dev/mem mapping happened and we have invalid memory access.

Mapping /dev/mem and accidentally being able to read/write virtio-mem 
memory has to be forbidden in sane environments. Force unloading a 
driver or preventing it from loading just to touch virtio-mem memory via 
/dev/mem is not a sane environment, someone is explicitly is asking for 
trouble, which is fine.

That the spec defines that that memory must not be read/written, because 
there might not be any memory after all anymore backing the virtio-mem 
device, or there is and the hypervisor will flag you as "malicious" and 
eventually zap the VM. That's different to most physical devices I am 
aware of.

Right.

I could most certainly be convinced to

a) Leave CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM=n untouched
b) Restrict what I propose to CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM=y.

I could even go ahead and require CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM for virtio-mem.
