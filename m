All the above seems correct.

There might actually be two possibilities why the transition fails
too often:

1. The task might be in the running state most of the time. Therefore
   the backtrace is not reliable most of the time.

   In this case, some cooperation with the scheduler would really
   help. We would need to stop the task and check the stack
   when it is stopped. Something like the patch you proposed.


2. The task might be sleeping but almost always in a livepatched
   function. Therefore it could not be transitioned.

   It might be the case with vhost_worker(). The main loop is "tiny".
   The kthread probaly spends most of the time with processing
   a vhost_work. And if the "works" are livepatched...

   In this case, it would help to call klp_try_switch_task(current)
   in the main loop in vhost_worker(). It would always succeed
   when vhost_worker() is not livepatched on its own.

   Note that even this would not help with kPatch when a single
   vhost_work might need more than the 1 minute timout to get proceed.

Nice. I am surprised that it can be implemented so easily.
