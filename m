So, looking at the standard again, the device is actually required to
reject the READ_STATUS if only rev 1 had been negotiated... regardless
of that, I don't think we should change QEMU's behaviour, as it would
affect existing guests (they would lose access to the status bits as
observed by the device, including DEVICE_NEEDS_RESET.)

Maybe it is, given the MUST reject clause in the standard?
