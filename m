Who said IOMMU instance? As a reminder, the patch I currently have[1] is 
matching the driver (via the device ops), which happens to be entirely 
compatible with drivers supporting cross-instance domains. Mostly 
because we already have drivers that support cross-instance domains and 
callers that use them.

Again, not what I was suggesting. In fact the nature of 
iommu_attach_group() already rules out bogus devices getting this far, 
so all a driver currently has to worry about is compatibility of a 
device that it definitely probed with a domain that it definitely 
allocated. Therefore, from a caller's point of view, if attaching to an 
existing domain returns -EINVAL, try another domain; multiple different 
existing domains can be tried, and may also return -EINVAL for the same 
or different reasons; the final attempt is to allocate a fresh domain 
and attach to that, which should always be nominally valid and *never* 
return -EINVAL. If any attempt returns any other error, bail out down 
the usual "this should have worked but something went wrong" path. Even 
if any driver did have a nonsensical "nothing went wrong, I just can't 
attach my device to any of my domains" case, I don't think it would 
really need distinguishing from any other general error anyway.

Once multiple drivers are in play, the only addition is that the 
"gatekeeper" check inside iommu_attach_group() may also return -EINVAL 
if the device is managed by a different driver, since that still fits 
the same "try again with a different domain" message to the caller.

It's actually quite neat - basically the exact same thing we've tried to 
do with -EMEDIUMTYPE here, but more self-explanatory, since the fact is 
that a domain itself should never be invalid for attaching to via its 
own ops, and a group should never be inherently invalid for attaching to 
a suitable domain, it is only ever a particular combination of group (or 
device at the internal level) and domain that may not be valid together. 
Thus as long as we can maintain that basic guarantee that attaching a 
group to a newly allocated domain can only ever fail for resource 
allocation reasons and not some spurious "incompatibility", then we 
don't need any obscure trickery, and a single, clear, error code is in 
fact enough to say all that needs to be said.

Whether iommu_attach_device() should also join the party and start 
rejecting non-singleton-group devices with a different error, or 
maintain its current behaviour since its legacy users already have their 
expectations set, is another matter in its own right.

Cheers,
Robin.
