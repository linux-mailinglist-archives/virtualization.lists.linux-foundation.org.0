I've not looked at the code in quite a bit - please bear with me as I
refresh my memory.

I think the backward compat concern I have here is that a really old
hypervisor - one that doesn't do virtio-serial-ports yet, will not have
any other messages sent from the host, but the original console setup
messages.

The is_serial_port() check looks for whether hvc is initialized.  It's
possible hvc may not have been initialized when some control message
comes in.

Did you actually run into some issue here?
