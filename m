So you are trading one syzbot triggered issue for another one in the
future?  :)

If this ever can happen, handle it, but don't log it with a WARN_ON() as
that will trigger the panic-on-warn boxes, as well as syzbot.  Unless
you want that to happen?

And what happens if the mutex is locked _RIGHT_ after you checked it?
You still have a race...

thanks,
