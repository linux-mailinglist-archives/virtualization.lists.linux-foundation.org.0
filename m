Unfortunately reordering the fields would break existing devices and
drivers since they access flags and fwd_cnt at a specific offset in
struct virtio_vsock_hdr.

Thinking more about the union idea, I think it's more trouble than it is
worth. You could just write dgram_timestamp accessor functions that
split/join the le64 value into the existing le32 flags and fwd_cnt
fields.

The VIRTIO specification does not depend on the internals of device
implementations. Someone reading the spec must be able to implement a
driver or a device without knowledge of the Linux virtio_vsock or
vhost_vsock implementations.

If dgram_tx_bytes is a new concept that device implementations must
incorporate, then please describe it fully in the spec.

I'm not sure why this mechanism is needed since the virtqueue has a
fixed size and the receiver has socket buffers (rcvbuf) of fixed sizes.
Memory usage is bounded so I don't understand how OOM can occur.

I would have expected the following:
1. When sending, drop VIRTIO_VSOCK_OP_RW packets instead of sending if
   the virtqueue is full.
2. When receiving, drop VIRTIO_VSOCK_OP_RW packets if the socket rcvbuf
   is full.

That's all. No additional accounting mechanism is necessary for
unreliable delivery.

Why is the timestamp included in the header? It seems to only be used by
the side that is sending so it's not obvious to me that it needs to be
sent to the other side.

How does timestamp ensure fairness? It seems like the malicious sending
could simple send more packets in order to exhaust all available memory
again when its old packets expire.

POSIX Sockets have a send socket buffer (sndbuf) for that. The sender
should use a similar approach to how UDP sockets work.

To summarize:

1. Why is dgram_tx_bytes needed since the virtqueue already has a finite
   size?

2. Does the timestamp field provide fairness between senders? I don't
   understand its purpose.

3. vsock dgram should probably follow the UDP approach to memory
   accounting instead of inventing new mechanisms. Applications and
   developers will probably be happiest with UDP-like behavior.
