This is an interesting limitation in DPU.

In general we have talked about multiqueue support in the past but
nothing actually made upstream. So if there are patches to make
it happen, it should be reasonable to look at these and review.

Is it just a theory at this point of time or have you implemented
it and seeing significant performance benefit with multiqueue?
