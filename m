If not, then we should go with #2 since #1 has negative performance implications for the map_sync call as it is used for every packet in the data path. Could also argue that #1 is overdoing it until we know that there will be more sets of DMA operations than these two.

In my opinion, only virtio should be special. So my choice #1.

In the previous patch set, the page was acquired and then passed to virtio, and
virtio implemented DMA. From a performance point of view, the idea of XSK's
advanced DMA is better, so I consider the idea of using advanced DMA in the next
version of the patch set.
