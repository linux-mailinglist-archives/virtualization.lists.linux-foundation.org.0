IIUC we are talking about a use after free here since we somehow
managed to have a pointer to the device in a worker while
device is being destroyed.

That's the point of the warning as use after free is hard to debug. You
ask can we recover from a use after free? 

As regards to the added lock, IIUC it kind of shifts the use after free
window to later and since we zero out some of the memory just before we
free it, it's a bit more likely to recover.  I would still like to see
some more analysis on why the situation is always better than it was
before though.
