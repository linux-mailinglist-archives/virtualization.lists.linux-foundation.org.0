Fair enough, but that should come first IMO. Really I just want to see
a complete picture. That can be a reference to a git branch(es) or
other patch series. But again, what I want to see in particular is the
actual DT and validation run on it.

Another issue yes, but orthogonal to my comments.

You are missing 'ranges' here. Without it, addresses aren't translatable.

You are also missing 'compatible = "simple-bus";'. This happens to
work on x86 because of legacy reasons, but we don't want new cases
added.

'Microsoft' is not a vendor prefix.

All these comments are unnecessary because the tools will now check
these things and we shouldn't have to.
