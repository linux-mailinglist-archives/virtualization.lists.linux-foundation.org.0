Sure, Let's drop this idea. Thanks to all for the suggestions.

Hi, Naoya
It seems that memory failure notifier is not required currently, so I'll 
not push the next version of:
[PATCH 1/3] memory-failure: Introduce memory failure notifier
[PATCH 2/3] mm/memory-failure.c: support reset PTE during unpoison

Thanks you for review work!

I guess unpoison_memory() is designed/tested by hwpoison-inject only, I 
have no idea to fix memory failure on a hardware platform. I suppose 
it's the first time that unpoison_memory() is required by hardware-level 
(balloon VQ).
