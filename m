Ah, new information.
That's not quite what the commit message describes.

Not so far as I know.

So it's an exploder not an actual maintainer and it likely isn't
publically archived with any normal list mechanism.

So IMO "private" isn't appropriate.  Neither is "L:"
Perhaps just mark it as what it is as an "exploder".

Or maybe these blocks should be similar to:

M:	Name of Lead Developer <somebody@vmware.com>
M:	VMware <foo> maintainers <linux-<foo>-maintainers@vmlinux.com>

Maybe something like a comment mechanism should be added to the
MAINTAINERS file.

Maybe #

so this entry could be something like:

M:	VMware <foo> maintainers <linux-<foo>-maintainers@vmlinux.com> # VMware's ever changing internal maintainers list
