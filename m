BTW, the general issue here is that "we don't know what the hypervisor
will do".

Maybe "MemMax" actually could make sense, where we expose the maximum
"MemTotal" we had so far since we were up an running. So the semantics
wouldn't be "maximum possible", because we don't know that, but instead
"maximum we had".
