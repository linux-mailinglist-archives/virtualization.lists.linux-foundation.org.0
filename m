Hi Marc,

I'm definitely eager to see your approach. I was actually working on
a second version of EFI support for ARM using the stub approach like
this series before getting perpetually sidetracked. I've been wanted
to experiment with Varad's code to continue that, but haven't been
able to find the time. I'm curious if you considered the stub approach
as well, but then opted for the app approach in the end. I was
leaning towards the stub approach to avoid the gnu-efi dependency.

Thanks,
drew
