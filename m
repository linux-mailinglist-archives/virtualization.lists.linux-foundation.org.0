Aha, TDISP.  But that one clearly does not need and can not use
this kind of hack?

First there's some logic here such as translating legacy IO
offsets to modern ones that could be reused.

But also, this is not just IO BAR, that indeed can be easily done in
software.  When a device operates in legacy mode there are subtle
differences with modern mode such as a different header size for the net
device.

Not exactly. What I had in mind is just having the logic in
the vdpa module so users don't need to know what does the device
support and what it doesn't. If we can we bypass mediation
(to simplify the software stack) if we can not we do not.

Looking at it from user's POV, it is just super confusing that
card ABC would need to be used with VDPA to drive legacy while
card DEF needs to be used with VFIO. And both VFIO and VDPA
will happily bind, too. Oh man ...
