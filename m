I suggest renaming "rx" and "tx" to "stream rx" and "stream tx"
virtqueues and also adding this:

  When behavior differs between stream and datagram rx/tx virtqueues
  their full names are used. Common behavior is simply described in
  terms of rx/tx virtqueues and applies to both stream and datagram
  virtqueues.

This way you won't need to duplicate portions of the spec that deal with
populating the virtqueues, for example.

It's also clearer to use a full name for stream rx/tx virtqueues instead
of calling them rx/tx virtqueues now that we have datagram rx/tx
virtqueues.

Plus unordered (?) and with message boundaries. In other words:

  Datagram sockets provide unordered, unreliable, connectionless message
  with message boundaries and a fixed maximum length.

I didn't think of the fixed maximum length aspect before. I guess the
intention is that the rx buffer size is the message size limit? That's
different from UDP messages, which can be fragmented into multiple IP
packets and can be larger than 64KiB:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol#UDP_datagram_structure

Is it possible to support large datagram messages in vsock? I'm a little
concerned that applications that run successfully over UDP will not be
portable if vsock has this limitation because it would impose extra
message boundaries that the application protocol might not tolerate.

Plus:

  ... according to the the driver and device's available memory
  resources. The amount of tx buffer space is an implementation detail
  of both the device and the driver. It is not visible to the other side
  and may be controlled by the application or administrative resource
  limits.

What I'm trying to describe here is that the additional tx buffer space
isn't part of the device interface.

MUST, SHOULD, etc clauses need to go into the
devicenormative/drivernormative sections. They cannot be in regular
text.

UDP is connectionless so any number of other sources can send messages
to the same destination, causing buf_alloc's value to be unpredictable.
Can you explain how buf_alloc works with datagram sockets in more
detail?

It's unclear whether the caller is the driver/device or something else.
I think you're referring to the application interace, which is outside
the scope of the VIRTIO spec. I suggest dropping the last sentence.
