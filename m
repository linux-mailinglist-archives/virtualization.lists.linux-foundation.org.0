I always ask that the current maintainers of the code be cc:ed when
asking for commits to be backported to the stable tree, so I think this
is not something you need to worry about.  I don't want to have to deal
with hundreds of patches to try to keep the MAINTAINERS file "up to
date" for this very very rare event.

You can prove me wrong by looking at our email archives and see where I
have missed ever doing this in the past 18 years and what the frequency
of it is...

But for now, no, this is not stable kernel material.
