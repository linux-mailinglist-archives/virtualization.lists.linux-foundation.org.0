But that was due to performance problems in hot paths. Nothing of this

What is confusing exactly?

For me it both seems very straight forward and simple (but then I'm biased)

The policy is:

- Have an allow list at driver registration.

- Have an additional opt-in for MMIO mappings (and potentially config 
space, but that's not currently there) to cover init calls completely.

A hardened driver is a driver that

- Had similar security (not API) oriented review of its IO operations 
(mainly MMIO access, but also PCI config space) as a non privileged user 
interface (like a ioctl). That review should be focused on memory safety.

- Had some fuzzing on these IO interfaces using to be released tools.

Right now it's only three virtio drivers (console, net, block)

Really it's no different than what we do for every new unprivileged user 
interface.

I don't think arguments from "the average kernel config" (if such a 
thing even exists) are useful. That's would be just hand waving.

That would be already hundreds of changes. I have no idea how such a 
thing could be maintained or sustained either.

Really I don't even see how these alternatives can be considered. Tree 
sweeps should always be last resort. They're a pain for everyone. But 
here they're casually thrown around as alternatives to straight forward 
one or two line changes.

All the hardening and auditing happens in the kernel tree. So it seems 
the natural place to store the result is in the kernel tree.

But there's no single package for initrd, so you would need custom 
configurations for all the supported distros.

Also we're really arguing about a list that currently has three entries.

You mean the event list? perf is in the kernel tree, so it's maintained 
together with the kernel.

But we don't have a kernel initrd.

But how do you debug the kernel then? Making early undebuggable seems 
just bad policy to me.

And if you fix if for the console why not add the two more entries for 
virtio net and block too?
