I agree that even if the device is discoverable at runtime, we should
still have some sort of stuff in DT to distinguish the devices, and
"virtio,deviceDID" sounds good enough for that, considering that we
already do it for USB, etc.

And I am fine with both the ways, a new node or just using the parent
node. So whatever you guys decide is fine.

Or it can be firmware controlled device as well, as Rob said earlier.
I think that's what Vincent will be doing for SCMI.

Though all I have tested until now is direct userspace access.
