Thinking little bit more about this from requirement perspective. I think
we are trying to address two use cases here.

A. Client does not know which files DAX should be used on. Only server
   knows it and server passes this information to client. I suspect
   that's your primary use case.

B. Client is driving which files are supposed to be using DAX. This is
   exactly same as the model ext4/xfs are using by storing a persistent
   flag on inode. 

Current patches seem to be a hybrid of both approach A and B. 

If we were to implement B, then fuse client probably needs to have the
capability to query FS_XFLAG_DAX on inode and decide whether to
enable DAX or not. (Without extra round trip). Or know it indirectly
by extending GETATTR and requesting this explicitly.

If we were only implementing A, then server does not have a way to 
tell client to enable DAX. Server can either look at FS_XFLAG_DAX
and decide to enable DAX or use some other property. Given querying
FS_XFLAG_DAX will be an extra ioctl() on every inode lookup/getattr,
it probably will be a server option. But enabling on server does not
mean client will enable it.

I think my primary concern with this patch right now is trying to
figure out which requirement we are trying to cater to first and how
to connect server and client well so they both understand what mode
they are operating in and interact well.
