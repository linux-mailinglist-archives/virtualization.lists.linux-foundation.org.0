So, how is the virtio core supposed to determine this? A
transport-specific callback?

Yes, since we introduced virtio 1 support, I guess...

Maybe not really a bug in the spec, but probably an issue, as this seems
to have been unclear to most people so far.

Worth noting that PCI and CCW are a tad different here: PCI exposes an
additional interface, while CCW uses a revision negotiation mechanism
(for CCW, legacy and standard-compliant are much closer on the transport
side as for PCI.) MMIO does not do transitional, if I'm not wrong.

What is supposed to happen for validate after FEATURES_OK? The driver
cannot change any features at that point in time, it can only fail to
use the device.

Do we need to consider migration, or do we not need to be bug-compatible
in this case?
