And I missed something. klp_update_patch_state_safe(), proposed below,
would not cover the above scenario.

It might be possible to add something similar to kthread()
function. I think that it is the only "livepatchable" function
that might call vhost_worker(). We could block
klp_update_patch_state() for the entire kthread when the kthread()
function is called from a livepatch.

Well, it is all just the best effort. The reference counting in
the ftrace handler would be more reliable. But it would require
adding the trampoline on the return.

I would probably go this way after all. Still thinking...
