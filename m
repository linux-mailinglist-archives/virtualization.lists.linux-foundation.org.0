Greg also reported a regression, plus I looked at the commit and had
questions too.

Tbh I haven't looked at the poll implementation, but it's fishy on
principles as in drm drivers shouldn't reinvent them. The commit message
cites vmwgfx as example for a private driver drm_event, but that works
perfectly fine with standard drm_poll (and is meant to work perfectly fine
with standard drm_poll).

So if it's buggy on top of questionable I think revert might be the right
choice irrespective of whether there's some fixes in-flight.

So if you end up pushing that revert:

Plus credit Greg too and all that ofc.

But lets wait a bit for virtio folks to chime in, it's only Monday :-)

Cheers, Daniel
