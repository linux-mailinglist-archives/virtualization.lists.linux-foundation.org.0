[Kasireddy, Vivek] Although, I have not tested it yet but it looks like this will
throw a wrench in our solution as we use sg_next to iterate over all the struct page *
and get their PFNs. I wonder if there is any other clean way to get the PFNs of all 
the pages associated with a dmabuf.

[Kasireddy, Vivek] To exclude such cases, would it not be OK to limit the scope 
of this solution (Vdmabuf) to make it clear that the dma-buf has to live in Guest RAM?
Or, are there any ways to pin the dma-buf pages in Guest RAM to make this
solution work?

[Kasireddy, Vivek] That might work but I am afraid it means making invasive changes
to the Guest GPU driver (i915 in our case) which we are trying to avoid to
keep this solution more generic.

[Kasireddy, Vivek] Let me present more details about the use-case we are trying to solve;
Sorry for the crude graphic below:

Guest:						Host:
+-----------+					+----------------+
|   Weston  |					|    Qemu UI	|
|(Headless)|					|		|
+-----------+					+-^--------------+
         |  (1. Export prime fd	  (3.Share UUID |	       |  (4. Qemu calls Import using this UUID and a gets a new Dmabuf
         |   of scanout buffer)	     with Qemu)   |	       |   fd that is used with EGL_LINUX_DMA_BUF_EXT)
+-----v-------------+				+------------v-----+
|Virtio-Vdmabuf  |------------------------------->|Vhost-Vdmabuf|
|                            | (2.Generate & share UUID|	                |
+--------------------+ and PFNs for this buffer) +------------------+

Here is a link to the Weston Headless backend that we tested:
https://github.com/vivekkreddy/Intel-Distribution-of-Weston/blob/vdmabuf/libweston/backend-headless/headless.c#L287
And, here is the link to the Qemu part:
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2021-02/msg02976.html

IIUC, Virtio GPU is used to present a virtual GPU to the Guest and all the rendering 
commands are captured and forwarded to the Host GPU via Virtio. However, in our
use-case, we are passthrough'ing a real GPU (claimed by i915 running in the Guest)
that is Headless; hence, we need to use Weston with the headless backend. The 
rendering in the Guest is accomplished via the unmodified native stack that includes 
Iris and i915. Therefore, it would not be efficient to use virtio-gpu for rendering or
for any other purpose in the Guest given that we could use the native stack which
is definitely faster. 

We really want to make this solution GPU driver (Host and Guest) agnostic and for
that reason it would need to rely on Dmabuf interfaces/APIs and preferrably avoid
making modifications to the native DRM drivers.

Thanks,
Vivek
