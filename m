Completely untested alternative could be based on the offset size, that is if it has
eaten into the headroom and is smaller then we swap them (that means we start at page
boundary since we have headroom guaranteed space):
 buf = page_address(page) + (offset > headroom ? offset - headroom : 0);

or perhaps in current code terms:
 buf = p - (offset > headroom ? headroom : offset);

That means offset is somewhere inside the headroom of the buf and, the buf itself
starts at page boundary (when offset < headroom). I think this preserves the correct
headroom for the new skb. WDYT?

Cheers,
 Nik
