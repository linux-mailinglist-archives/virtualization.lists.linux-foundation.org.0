Hi Arseniy,
sorry for the delay, but I was offline.

I will review for the vsock point of view. Hope some net maintainers can
comment about SO_ZEROCOPY.

Anyway I think is a good idea to keep it as close as possible to the TCP
implementation.

Are these pages exposed to the host via virtqueues? If so, I think we
should pin them. What happens if the host accesses them but these pages
have been unmapped?

Yep, good idea.

I'll take a look, but if we have no alternative, I think it's okay to
make tx fail.

I see the problem and I think your approach is the right one.

loopback is useful for testing and debugging, so it would be great to
have the support, but if it's too complicated, we can do it later.

Yep, I think so.
When I started touching this code, the limit was already there.
As you said, I think it was introduced to have a limit on (host/device
side?) allocation, but buf_alloc might be enough, so maybe we could
also remove it for copy mode.
The only problem I see is compatibility with old devices/drivers, so
maybe we need a feature in the spec to say the limit is gone, or have a
field in the virtio config space where the device specifies its limit
(for the driver, the limit is implicitly that of the buffer allocated
and put in the virtqueue).

This reminded me that Laura had proposed something similar before,
maybe we should take it up again:

The host still needs to allocate and copy, so maybe the limitation
could be to avoid large allocations in the host, but actually the host
can use vmalloc because it doesn't need them to be contiguous.

Yep, I see.
Adjusting vsock_perf to compare also Gbps (can io_uring helps in this
case to have more requests in-flight?) would be great.

Great! Thanks for adding the tests!

I'll go through the patches between today and Monday.
Sorry again for taking so long!
