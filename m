Why would you change TSC offset after the point where a VM is started
and why would it be different per vCPU?

Time is global and time moves on when a vCPU is scheduled out. Anything
else is bonkers, really. If the hypervisor tries to screw with that then
how does the guest do timekeeping in a consistent way?

    CLOCK_REALTIME = CLOCK_MONOTONIC + offset

That offset changes when something sets the clock, i.e. clock_settime(),
settimeofday() or adjtimex() in case that NTP cannot compensate or for
the beloved leap seconds adjustment. At any other time the offset is
constant.

CLOCK_MONOTONIC is derived from the underlying clocksource which is
expected to increment with constant frequency and that has to be
consistent accross _all_ vCPUs of a particular VM.

So how would a hypervisor 'hide' scheduled out time w/o screwing up
timekeeping completely?

The guest TSC which is based on the host TSC is:

    guestTSC = offset + hostTSC * factor;

If you make offset different between guest vCPUs then timekeeping in the
guest is screwed.

The whole point of that paravirt clock was to handle migration between
hosts which did not have the VMCS TSC scaling/offset mechanism. The CPUs
which did not have that went EOL at least 10 years ago.

So what are you concerned about?

Thanks,
