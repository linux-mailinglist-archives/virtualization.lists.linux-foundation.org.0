Hi Jeffle,

If you access lot of big files or a file bigger than dax window, still
you will face performance drop due to reclaim. IOW, if data being
accessed is bigger than dax window, then reclaim will trigger and
performance drop will be observed. So I think its not fair to assciate
performance drop with big for small files as such.

What makes more sense is that memomry usage argument you have used
later in the email. That is, we have a fixed chunk size of 2MB. And
that means we use 512 * 64 = 32K of memory per chunk. So if a file
is smaller than 32K in size, it might be better to just access it
without DAX and incur the cost of page cache in guest instead. Even this
argument also works only if dax window is being utilized fully.

Anyway, I think Miklos already asked you to send patches so that
virtiofs daemon specifies which file to use dax on. So are you
planning to post patches again for that. (And drop patches to
read dax attr from per inode from filesystem in guest).

Thanks
Vivek
