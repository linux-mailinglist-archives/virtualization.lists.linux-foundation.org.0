[Kasireddy, Vivek] Oh, what I meant is whether you were suggesting that we 
create a GBM device and create a GBM surface and BOs using this device or
just create a raw/dumb GEM object and create a GBM BO by importing it. As
we just discovered, the former means we have to initialize virgl which complicates
things so we went with the latter.

[Kasireddy, Vivek] Vdmabuf v4, that implements your suggestion -- to have
Vdmabuf allocate pages --  is posted here:
https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2021-February/297841.html
and tested it with Weston Headless and Qemu:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/Vivek/weston/-/blob/vdmabuf/libweston/backend-headless/headless.c#L522
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2021-02/msg02976.html

Having said that, after discussing with Daniel Vetter, we are now switching our
focus to virtio-gpu to compare and contrast both solutions.

[Kasireddy, Vivek] Since we are testing with Weston, we are looking at pageflips (4 color
buffers). And, this part so far seems to work where virtio-gpu is used for kms (max_outputs=1)
and Iris/i915 is used for rendering. We are currently glueing virtio-gpu and i915 in Weston but
eventually the plan is to glue them (virgl/virtio-gpu and Iris) in Mesa if possible using KMSRO
(KMS render only) to avoid having to change Weston or X or other user-space components.

[Kasireddy, Vivek] IIUC, I think you are referring to creating the Pixman image in set_scanout.
What additional features need to be implemented or what is your recommendation in terms of
what needs to be done to turn the memcpy() into a dma-buf? Also, how should we ensure that
access to the guest fb/dmabuf is synchronized to ensure that the Guest and the Host do not access
the backing storage of the dmabuf at the same time?

Thanks,
Vivek
