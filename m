I addressed this in my other mail, but we may need more discussion.

Why not? Device filter and the opt-ins together are a fairly strong 
mechanism.

And it's not that they're a lot of code or super complicated either.

You're essentially objecting to a single line change in your subsystem here.


> How about creating a defconfig that makes sense for TDX then?

TDX can be used in many different ways, I don't think a defconfig is 
practical.

In theory you could do some Kconfig dependency (at the pain point of 
having separate kernel binariees), but why not just do it at run time 
then if you maintain the list anyways. That's much easier and saner for 
everyone. In the past we usually always ended up with runtime mechanism 
for similar things anyways.

Also it turns out that the filter mechanisms are needed for some arch 
drivers which are not even configurable, so alone it's probably not enough,

Hardening drivers is kernel policy. It cannot be done anywhere else.
