Requests are handled non-blocking with remote IO on the DPU. Our current 
architecture is as follows:
T1: Tends to the Virtq, parses FUSE to remote IO and fires off the 
asynchronous remote IO.
T2: Polls for completion on the remote IO and parses it back to FUSE, 
puts the FUSE buffers in a completion queue of T1.
T1: Handles the Virtio completion and DMA of the requests in the CQ.

Thread 1 is busy polling on its two queues (Virtq and CQ) with equal 
priority, thread 2 is busy polling as well. This setup is not really 
optimal, but we are working within the constraints of both our DPU and 
remote IO stack.
Currently we are able to get with sequential single job 4k throughput:
Write: 246MiB/s
Read: 20MiB/s
We are not sure yet where the bottleneck is for reads, we hope to be 
able to match it to the write speed. For writes the two main bottlenecks 
we see are: the single Virtq (so limited parallelism on the DPU and 
remote-side) and that virtio-fs IO is constrained to the page size of 4k 
(NFS for example, who we are trying to replace, sees huge performance 
gains with larger block sizes).

Thanks for the pointers. :)
