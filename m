Okay, the unwinder will likely get confused by this logic.

Cases when there are multiple IST vectors besides NMI that can hit while
the #VC handler is still on its own IST stack. #MCE comes to mind, but
that is broken anyway. At some point #VC itself will be one of them, but
when that happens the code will kill the machine.
This leaves #HV in the list, and I am not sure how that is going to be
handled yet. I think the goal is that the #HV handler is not allowed to
cause any #VC exception. In that case the linked-list logic will not be
needed.

See the entry code in arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S, macro idtentry_vc. It
creates the assembly code for the handler. At some point it calls
vc_switch_off_ist(), which is a C function in arch/x86/kernel/traps.c.
This function tries to find a new stack for the #VC handler.

The first thing it does is checking whether the exception came from the
SYSCALL gap and just uses the task stack in that case.

Then it will check for other kernel stacks which are safe to switch
to. If that fails it uses the fall-back stack (VC2), which will direct
the handler to a separate function which, for now, just calls panic().
Not safe are the entry or unknown stacks.

The function then copies pt_regs and returns the new stack pointer to
assembly code, which then writes it to %RSP.

You are right, forgot about this. The MOV SS bug can very well
trigger a #VC(#DB) exception from the syscall gap.

Not sure what you mean by EFLAGS.IF violations, probably enabling IRQs
while in the #VC handler? The #VC handler _must_ _not_ enable IRQs
anywhere in its call-path. If that ever happens it is a bug.
