the concern is that you touch many cache lines when removing an entry.

I suggest something like:

llist: add a non-atomic list_del_first

One has to know what one's doing, but if one has locked the list
preventing all accesses, then it's ok to just pop off an entry without
atomics.

It's true that desc queue might be cross numa, and people are looking
for ways to improve that. Not a reason to make things worse ...

Using it from current node like we do now seems better.

I liked how in older versions adding indrect enabled it implicitly
though without need to hack drivers.

I know. My question is this, do devices know what a good threshold is?
If yes how do they know?

Do you mean kmem_cache_alloc_bulk/kmem_cache_free_bulk?
You mentioned just kmem_cache_alloc previously.
