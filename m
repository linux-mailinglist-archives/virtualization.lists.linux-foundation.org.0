Surprising to me that the virtio spec dictates subsystem device ID in
all cases.  The further discussion in this thread seems to indicate we
need to virtualize subsystem vendor ID for broader driver compatibility
anyway.

That's the same argument I'd make for re-using the core code, we don't
need multiple implementations handling merging physical and virtual
bits within config space.

We're already on the verge of the v6.7 merge window, so this looks like
v6.8 material anyway.  We have time.  Thanks,
