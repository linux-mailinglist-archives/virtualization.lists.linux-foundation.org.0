Nice idea :). Then there would be no need for changes to the hardware
interface. IRQ-less virtqueues is could still be mentioned explicitly in
the VIRTIO spec so that driver/device authors are aware of the
VIRTIO_MSI_NO_VECTOR trick.

Yes. An example blk_poll() user is
fs/block_dev.c:__blkdev_direct_IO_simple():

  qc =3D submit_bio(&bio);
  for (;;) {
      set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
      if (!READ_ONCE(bio.bi_private))
          break;
      if (!(iocb->ki_flags & IOCB_HIPRI) ||
          !blk_poll(bdev_get_queue(bdev), qc, true))
          blk_io_schedule();
  }

That's the infinite loop. The block layer implements the generic portion
of blk_poll(). blk_poll() calls mq_ops->poll() (virtblk_poll()).

So in general the polling loop will keep iterating, but there are
exceptions:
1. need_resched() causes blk_poll() to return 0 and blk_io_schedule()
   will be called.
2. blk-mq has a fancier io_poll algorithm that estimates I/O time and
   sleeps until the expected completion time to save CPU cycles. I
   haven't looked into detail at this one.

Both these cases affect existing mq_ops->poll() implementations (e.g.
NVMe). What's new in this patch series is that virtio-blk could have
non-polling requests on the virtqueue which now has irqs disabled. So we
could wait for them.

I think there's an easy solution for this: don't disable virtqueue irqs
when there are non-REQ_HIPRI requests in flight. The disadvantage is
that we'll keep irqs disable in more situations so the performance
improvement may not apply in some configurations.
