Okay, now it's clear. The transmitter doesn't care about the receiver's 
credit, but the receiver uses that part of the credit mechanism to 
discard packets.

I think that's fine, but when you send the patches, explain it well in 
the cover letter/commit message.

It's my fault because I didn't have time, I saw the link. :-)

Remember that we should also plan changes to the VIRTIO spec for the 
DGRAM support.
