The transport needs to set this as soon as it has figured out whether
we're using legacy or not. I guess we also need to fence off any
accesses respectively error out the device if the driver tries any
read/write operations that would depend on that knowledge?

And using a field in VirtIODevice would probably need some care when
migrating. Hm...
