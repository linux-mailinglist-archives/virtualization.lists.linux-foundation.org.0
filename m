What is implemented in this patchset: enablement for dm-thinp to
actually provide guarantees which fallocate requires.

Seems you're getting hung up on the finishing details in HW (details
which are _not_ the point of this patchset).

The proposed changes are in service to _Linux_ code. The patchset
implements the primitive from top (ext4) to bottom (dm-thinp, loop).
It stops short of implementing handling everywhere that'd need it
(e.g. in XFS, etc). But those changes can come as follow-on work once
the primitive is established top to bottom.

But you know all this ;)

This doesn't need to be so feudal.  Reserving an LBA in physical HW
really isn't the point.

Fact remains: an operation that ensures space is actually reserved via
fallocate is long overdue (just because an FS did its job doesn't mean
underlying layers reflect that). And certainly useful, even if "only"
benefiting dm-thinp and the loop driver. Like other block primitives,
REQ_OP_PROVISION is filtered out by block core if the device doesn't
support it.

That said, I agree with Brian Foster that we need really solid
documentation and justification for why fallocate mode=0 cannot be
used (but the case has been made in this thread).

Also, I do see an issue with the implementation (relative to stacked
devices): dm_table_supports_provision() is too myopic about DM. It
needs to go a step further and verify that some layer in the stack
actually services REQ_OP_PROVISION. Will respond to DM patch too.
