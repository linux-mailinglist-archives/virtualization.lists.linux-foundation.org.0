The original virtio was quite easy to exploit because it put its free 
list into the shared ring buffer.

We had a patchkit to harden virtio originally, but after some discussion 
we instead switched to Jason Wang's patchkit to move the virtio metadata 
into protected memory, which fixed near all of the issues. These patches 
have been already merged. There is one additional patch to limit the 
virtio modes.

There's an ongoing effort to audit (mostly finished I believe) and fuzz 
the three virtio drivers (fuzzing is still ongoing).

There was also a range of changes outside virtio for code outside the 
device model. Most of it was just disabling it though.
