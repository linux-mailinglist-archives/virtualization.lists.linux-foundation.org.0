Yes, that problem kind of cascades down.

Yes. I'm not so sure forcing the device to reject the command was such
a good idea anyway, and relaxing the requirement keeps existing
implementations in compliance.

I've opened https://github.com/oasis-tcs/virtio-spec/issues/96 and will
send a patch for the spec later.

We would also need to actively check for success or failure of the
channel program in that case.

I'm currently looking at the virtio-ccw code anyway, so I can put that
on my list as well.

Thanks!

I'll do a v2 with a tweaked commit message and cc:stable.
