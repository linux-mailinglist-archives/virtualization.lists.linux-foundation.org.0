> The vsock_diag.ko module already has a test suite but the core AF_VSOCK

> The v1 of this series was originally sent by Stefan.

> v3:
> - Patch 6:
>   * check the byte received in the recv_byte()
>   * use send(2)/recv(2) instead of write(2)/read(2) to test also flags
>     (e.g. MSG_PEEK)
> - Patch 8:
>   * removed unnecessary control_expectln("CLOSED") [Stefan].
> - removed patches 9,10,11 added in the v2
> - new Patch 9 add parameters to list and skip tests (e.g. useful for vmci
>   that doesn't support half-closed socket in the host)
> - new Patch 10 prints a list of options in the help
> - new Patch 11 tests MSG_PEEK flags of recv(2)

> v2: https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/cover/1140538/
