Another crazy idea:

/**
 * klp_update_patch_state_safe() - do not update the path state when
 *	called from a livepatch.
 * @task: task_struct to be updated
 * @calller_addr: address of the function which  calls this one
 *
 * Do not update the patch set when called from a livepatch.
 * It would allow to remove the livepatch module even when
 * the code still might be in use.
 */
void klp_update_patch_state_safe(struct task_struct *task, void *caller_addr)
{
	static bool checked;
	static bool safe;

	if (unlikely(!checked)) {
		struct module *mod;

		preempt_disable();
		mod = __module_address(caller_addr);
		if (!mod || !is_livepatch_module(mod))
			safe = true;
		checked = true;
		preempt_enable();
	}

	if (safe)
		klp_update_patch_state(task);
}

and use in vhost_worker()

		if (unlikely(klp_patch_pending(current)))
			klp_update_patch_state_safe(current, vhost_worker);

Even better might be to get the caller address using some compiler
macro. I guess that it should be possible.

And even better would be to detect this at the compile time. But
I do not know how to do so.

Yes, the best place probably would be "7. Limitations" section in
Documentation/livepatch/livepatch.rst.

Even better would be to add a document about the best practices.
We have dreamed about it for years ;-)

Right. I knew that it could not be that easy. Otherwise, we would have
used it. I just did not spent enough cycles on the idea yesterday.

It would be acceptable for me if we added a warning above the function
definition and into the livepatch documentation.

But I would prefer klp_update_patch_state_safe() if it worked. It is
possible that I have missed something.
