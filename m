A record can be sent using one or more output operations and received using one or more input operations, but a single operation never transfers part of more than one record. Record boundaries are visible to the receiver via the MSG_EOR flag.

Would not that violate the reliable property? IIUC it's only ok to
return an error if socket gets closed. Just like e.g. TCP ...
