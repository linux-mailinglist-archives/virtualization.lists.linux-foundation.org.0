Yes, exactly.

I'm not sure what that commit is having to do with lifetimes, it did not
change anything, only added the extra interaction for the dma buffer.

Basically, the vcdev is supposed to be around while the ccw device is
online (with a tail end until references have been given up, of course.)
It embeds a virtio device that has the ccw device as a parent, which
will give us a reference on the ccw device as long as the virtio device
is alive. Any interactions with the ccw device (except freeing the dma
buffer) are limited to the time where we still have a reference to it
via the virtio device.

But the problem is the dma memory, right? Also, it is the same issue for
any potential caller of the ccw_device_dma_* interfaces.

I don't think we have to care about accessing ->cdev (see above.) Plus,
as we give up the dma memory at the very last point, we would also give
up the reference via that memory at the very last point, so I'm not sure
what additional problems could come up.
