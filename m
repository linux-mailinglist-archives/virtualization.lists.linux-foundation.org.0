Yes they have been in the header but they are not used by *Linux* yet.
My worry is for when we start using them and then someone backports
the patches without backporting the macro fix.
Maybe we should just drop these until there's a user, but I am
a bit wary of a step like this so late in the cycle.

OK I will stop doing this.
I thought they are handy for when there are several versions of the
patch. It helps me make sure I applied the latest one. Saving the
message ID of the original mail in some other way would also be ok.
Any suggestions for a better way to do this?
