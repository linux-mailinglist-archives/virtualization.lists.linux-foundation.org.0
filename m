Sure, but it's the whole "unfinalised domains" and rewriting 
domain->pgsize_bitmap after attach thing that is itself the massive 
hack. AMD doesn't do that, and doesn't need to; it knows the appropriate 
format at allocation time and can quite happily return a fully working 
domain which allows map before attach, but the old ops->pgsize_bitmap 
mechanism fundamentally doesn't work for multiple formats with different 
page sizes. The only thing I'd accuse it of doing wrong is the weird 
half-and-half thing of having one format as a default via one mechanism, 
and the other as an override through the other, rather than setting both 
explicitly.

virtio isn't setting ops->pgsize_bitmap for the sake of direct mappings 
either; it sets it once it's discovered any instance, since apparently 
it's assuming that all instances must support identical page sizes, and 
thus once it's seen one it can work "normally" per the core code's 
assumptions. It's also I think the only driver which has a "finalise" 
bodge but *can* still properly support map-before-attach, by virtue of 
having to replay mappings to every new endpoint anyway.

I fail to see how that would make any practical difference. Either the 
mappings can be correctly set up in a pagetable *before* the relevant 
device is attached to that pagetable, or they can't (if the driver 
doesn't have enough information to be able to do so) and we just have to 
really hope nothing blows up in the race window between attaching the 
device to an empty pagetable and having a second try at 
iommu_create_device_direct_mappings(). That's a driver-level issue and 
has nothing to do with pgsize_bitmap either way.

Thanks,
Robin.
