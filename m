Ahh, so you are suggesting of just sending the request without waiting
for the response. We can do it, but I am not sure if it is going to be
worth it considering the additional complexity in the driver.

Maybe lets come back to this later, if this is going to make anything
better, once the basic support for irqs look good here.

Yes, you are right. I was having a mess because of all the races and
different ways things were getting called.

I am not worried about that case only, i.e. where the
interrupt-handler disables the interrupt. It should work fine though,
even if it isn't optimized.

A) If the client has registered with irq with IRQF_ONESHOT, irq core
   will call ->irq_mask(), irq-handler(), ->irq_eoi(), and finally
   ->irq_unmask(). Looking at this basic sequence itself, irq_eoi()
   shouldn't enable the interrupt again by re-queuing the buffer,
   rather it should happen from unmask in this case.

B) If the client has registered a threaded-irq, it gets even more
   complex. The core does this in that case:

   call ->irq_mask(), ->irq_eoi(), and return control back to
   virtio_gpio_event_vq().

   The thread gets scheduled then and calls the irq-handler and then
   the irq-core calls irq-bus-lock(), ->irq_unmask(),
   irq-bus-unlock().

Looking at these, eoi shouldn't be queuing the buffer. Also, I wonder
if we should use handle_fasteoi_irq() here or something else.
