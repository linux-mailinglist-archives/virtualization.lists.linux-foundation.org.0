https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/10/6/60

But  again, onlining will overwrite the whole memmap right now and there 
is no way to identify if a memmap contains garbage or not.

We would have to identify/remember if re-onlining, but I am not yet sure 
if re-using memmaps when onlining is such a good idea ...
