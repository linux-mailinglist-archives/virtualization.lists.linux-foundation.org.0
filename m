One problematic thing is that adding memory to Linux by virtio-mem 
eventually consumes memory (e.g., the memmap), especially when having to 
to add a completely new memory block to Linux.

So if you're already under severe memory pressure, these allocations to 
bring up new memory can fail. The question is, if PSI can notify "early" 
enough such that this barely happens in practice.

There are some possible ways to mitigate:

1) Always keep spare memory blocks by virtio-mem added to Linux, that
    don't expose any memory yet. Memory from these block can be handed
    over to Linux without additional Linux allocations. Of course, they
    consume metadata, so one might want to limit them.

2) Implement memmap_on_memory support for virtio-mem. This might help in
    some setups, where the device block size is suitable.

Did you run into that scenario already during your experiments, and how 
did you deal with that?
