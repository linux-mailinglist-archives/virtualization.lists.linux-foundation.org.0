Why do you consider this a hack?

If the VMM implements the translation feature, it is right in my opinion 
that it does not enable the feature for the vhost device. Otherwise, if 
it wants the vhost device to do the translation, enable the feature and 
send the IOTLB messages to set the translation.

QEMU for example masks features when not required or supported.
crosvm should negotiate only the features it supports.

@Michael and @Jason can correct me, but if a vhost device negotiates 
VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM, then it expects the VMM to send IOTLB messages 
to set the translation.

Indeed that patch was to fix 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1894101

Yep, QEMU can use it.

I think so too, the implementation in vsock was done following 
vhost-net.

Thanks,
