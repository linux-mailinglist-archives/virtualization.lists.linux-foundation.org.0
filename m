We need to think about compatibility with old drivers.

What would happen in this case?

I think it's easier to use the second buffer, usually used for the =

payload, to carry the extra header. Also, we can leave hdr.len =3D 0, so =

we are sure that it is not counted in credit mechanism.

If the driver supports SEQPACKET, it knows it must fetch extra header =

when it must handle SEQ_BEGIN/SEQ_END.

If it is not clear, I'll try to provide a simple PoC of a patch.

Thanks,
Stefano
