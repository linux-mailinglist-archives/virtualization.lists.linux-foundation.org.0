There is technically nothing preventing us from consuming a single queue 
on multiple cores, however our current Virtio implementation (DPU-side) 
is set up with the assumption that you should never want to do that 
(concurrency mayham around the Virtqueues and the DMAs). So instead of 
putting all the work into reworking the implementation to support that 
and still incur the big overhead, we see it more fitting to amend the 
virtio-fs driver with multi-queue support.

It is a theory, but we are currently seeing that using the single 
request queue, the single core attending to that queue on the DPU is 
reasonably close to being fully saturated.

I figure this would be dependent on the workload and the users-needs.
Having many cores concurrently pulling on their own virtq and then 
immediately process the request locally would of course improve 
performance. But we are offloading all this work to the DPU, for 
providing high-throughput cloud services.

The virtio-blk use the queue assigned by the mq block layer and 
virtio-net the queue assigned from the net core layer correct?

If I interpret you correct, the round-robin strategy is done by 
assigning cores to queues round-robin, not per requests dynamically 
round-robin?
This is what I remembered as well, but can't find it clearly in the 
source right now, do you have references to the source for this?

This is something I unfortunately can't disclose at the moment.

Thanks,
