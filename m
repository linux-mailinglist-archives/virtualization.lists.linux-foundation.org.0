It's the linker (rather than the compiler) that'll generate the PLT if the
caller and callee are out of range at link time. There are a few other issues
too (e.g. no guarnatee that the PLT isn't used by multiple distinct callers,
CMODX patching requirements), so we'd have to generate a pseudo-PLT ourselves
at build time with a patching-friendly code sequence. Ard had a prototype for
that:

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/20211105145917.2828911-1-ardb@kernel.org/

... but that was sufficiently painful that we went with the current static key
approach:

Sure, but here we're just enabling/disabling a call, which we could treat
differently, or wrap at a different level within the scheduler code. I'm happy
to take a look at that.

Oh, I was under the impression that all could be disabled/skipped, which is
what a NULL target implied.

Thanks,
Mark.
