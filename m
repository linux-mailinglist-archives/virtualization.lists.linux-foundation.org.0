I have no recollection at all about what was talked about this, but in
certain virtualized cases you will always have two display systems
simultaneously:
- the guest display system which uses the nested KMS driver in the
  guest VM, which presents to
- a VM viewer application on the host, which presents via Wayland to
- the host display system which uses a hardware KMS driver.

Maybe it was more like that to test?
