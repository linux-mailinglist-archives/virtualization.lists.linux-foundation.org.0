The two new virt queues will be dedicated for the DGRAM packets. Current
queues are used by STREAM (and your SEQPACKET) and the credit
mechanism is bound up with current queues. For DGRAM, the packets can be lost
and no need to use the credit based mechanism. Allocating two new queues
will make this simpler and DGRAM will not interfere with the STREAM
or SEQPACKET.

Got it. Thanks. I will check it out.
