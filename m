Call for Workshops

The 31th International ACM Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and
Distributed Computing (HPDC'22)
Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, June 30 - July 1, 2022

Overview
The organizers of the 31st International ACM Symposium on High-Performance
Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC'22) call for proposals for
Workshops to be held with the main conference.
The HPDC Workshops provide forums for discussion among researchers and
practitioners on focused topics and/or emerging research areas relevant to
HPC and distributed computing.
Workshops typically include some combination of invited talks,
peer-reviewed papers, panel discussions, and work-in-progress talks.
Proposers should design workshops for approximately 20-40 participants,
lasting either one full day or one-half day, depending on interest and
space constraints. Proposals for workshops on new topics are welcome, as
are proposals to continue previously successful workshops. Tutorials that
would provide attendees with an interactive learning experience will be
given special consideration in acceptance. HPDC workshop proceedings will
be published by ACM in the HPDC proceedings companion book.

Proposal Submission
To Submit: Please email your proposal to Ivy Peng (peng8@llnl.gov) with the
title "HPDC'22 Workshop Proposal"

Formatting Guidelines
Workshop proposals should be formatted as a single PDF document of 2-4
pages, describing the following:
> The full name and acronym of the workshop
> Whether the workshop is planned for one full day or one half day
> A description of the theme and its key topics
> A description of the relevance to HPDC
> The structure of the workshop (peer-reviewed articles, invited articles,
invited talks, panels, etc.)
> Proposed names for invited speakers and panelists and their impacts on
the topics discussed at the workshop
> A tentative list of program committee members (optional)
> Details of the review process leading to acceptance to present at the
workshop
> If the workshop will have a call for papers, a tentative version of such
CFP (optional)
> If the workshop is going to have published papers, the type of papers to
be accepted and their length
> A summary of the intended audience
> A plan for attracting submissions and attendees to the workshop
> A plan for in-person + hybrid option
> A brief biographical information on the workshop organizers
> Data about previous editions of the workshop including attendance, number
of papers submitted and accepted

Accepted workshops will need to be ready to set up a website and, if a
paper submission process with peer review is going to be used, provide the
submission link.

Important Dates
Deadline for Workshop Proposals: January 15, 2022
Notification of Workshop Acceptance: January 31, 2022
Workshop Submission Deadlines: Late March, 2022*
Camera-Ready Deadline: Early May, 2022**

* could change slightly, to allow for the flow of borderline articles from
main conference to workshops
** could change slightly, to synchronize with the main conference
proceedings

Workshops Chair:
Ivy B. Peng, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (email:peng8@llnl.gov).
