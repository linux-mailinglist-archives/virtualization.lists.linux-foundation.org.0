That doesn't make sense btw.

Hmm, so no per process tracking (pid arg hard-coded to zero)?
Any plans for that?
The cgroups patches mentioned by Daniel should address that btw.

The gpu_id is hardcoded to zero too.  Shouldn't that be something like
the minor number of the drm device?  Or maybe something else in case you
need drm and non-drm gpu devices work side-by-side?

IIRC there have been discussions about a statfs, so you can export stats
with a sane interface without also enabling all the power provided by
debugfs, exactly because of the concerns to do that on production
systems.

Not sure what the state is, seems to not be upstream yet.  That would be
(beside cgroups) another thing to look at.

Sounds like you define "gpu memory" as "system memory used to store gpu
data".  Is that correct?  What about device memory?

Well, it is basically the same for all drivers using the gem shmem
helpers.  So I see little reason why we should do that at virtio-gpu
level.

Hmm, the tracepoint doesn't track which of the three groups the memory
belongs to.  Which I think is important, specifically group (2) because
that might already be accounted for by the exporting driver ...

I suspect once you figured that you'll notice that this little hack is
rather incomplete.
