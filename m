Not really, I don't think so.

There's no magic in more_used. No synchronization happens.
more_used is exactly like virtqueue_poll except
you get to maintain your own index.

As it is, it is quite possible to read the cached index,
then another thread makes 2^16 bufs available, then device
uses them all, and presto you get a false positive.

I guess we can play with memory barriers such that cache
read happens after the index read - but it seems that
will just lead to the same wrap around problem
in reverse. So IIUC it's quite a bit more involved than
just translating structures.

And yes, a more_used like API would remove the need to pass
the index around, but it will also obscure the fact that
there's internal state here and that it's inherently racy
wrt wrap arounds. Whereas I'm happy to see that virtqueue_poll
seems to have made it clear enough that people get it.


It's not hard to handle wrap around in the driver if you like though:
just have a 32 bit atomic counter and increment it each time you are
going to make 2^16 buffers available. That gets you to 2^48 with an
overhead of an atomic read and that should be enough short term. Make
sure the cache line where you put the counter is not needed elsewhere -
checking it in a tight loop with an atomic will force it to the local
CPU. And if you are doing that virtqueue_poll will be enough.
