It's an open question. E.g do we want a stable API for the those
statistics counter? If yes, it's better to not to let the parents to
report a subset but then it forces the exact same counters to be
supported by other vendors. If not, it should be fine. For any case, I
think it's simpler to start with "vendor-stats" and we can switch it
to a standard way if it was agreed by every vendor.

So at most 1 rollover I guess. So it's not hard by comparing the
indices. E.g the if last_avil_idx(device avail idx) > avail_idx, we
know there's one?
