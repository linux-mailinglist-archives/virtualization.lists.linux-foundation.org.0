For anything live migration it very fundamentally is not, as a function
that is visible to a guest by definition can't drive the migration
itself.  That isn't really a limitation in PCI, but follows form the
fact that something else must control a live migration that is
transparent to the guest.

The driver that knows this hardware.  In this case the virtio subsystem,
in case of nvme the nvme driver, and in case of mlx5 the mlx5 driver.

No.  That layout logically follows from what codebase the functionality
is part of, though.

The driver we're talking about in this thread fakes up a virtio_pci
legacy devie to the guest on top of a "modern" virtio_pci device.

I do not advocate for duplicating it.  But the code that calls this
functionality belongs into the driver that deals with the compound
device that we're doing this work for.

We don't need a dozen ways.  We just need a single attribute on the
pci (or $OTHERBUS) devide that switches it to vfio mode.
