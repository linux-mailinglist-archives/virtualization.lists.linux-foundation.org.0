Hm that sounds like a bridge too far? I don't think we want to start
adding moveable dma-bufs for shmem, thus far at least no one asked for
that. Goal here is just to streamline the locking a bit and align across
all the different ways of doing buffers in drm.

Or do you mean something else and I'm just completely lost?

Huh that sounds bad, how does this happen? Pretty much all pieces of
dma-buf (cpu vmap, userspace mmap, heck even dma_buf_attach) are optional
or at least can fail for various reasons. So exporters not providing mmap
support is fine, but importers then dying is not.

So maybe we're completely talking past each another, or coffee is not
working here on my end, but I've no idea what you mean.

We do have some helpers for taking care of the dma_resv_lock dance, and
Christian K=F6nig has an rfc patch set to maybe unify this further. But that
should be fairly orthogonal to reworking shmem (it might help a bit with
reworking shmem though).
