For stream socket, we have the send_pkt_list and the send worker because 
the virtqueue can be full and the transmitter needs to wait available 
slots, because we can't discard packets.

For dgram I think we don't need this, so we can avoid the 
dgram_send_pkt_list and directly enqueue packets in the virtqueue.

If there are no slots available, we can simply drop the packet.
In this way we don't have to put limits other than the available space 
in the virtqueue.

I think in both cases we don't need an accounting, but we can drop 
packets if the virtqueue is full.

It's still not clear to me where OOM may occur. Can you elaborate on 
this?

Yep.

I don't think we can use virtio_transport_inc_rx_pkt() for dgram.
This is based on the credit mechanism (e.g. buf_alloc) that works when 
you have a connection oriented socket.

With dgram you can have multiple transmitter for a single socket, so how 
we can exchange that information?

If we reuse the VMCI implementation with skbuff, the sk_receive_skb() 
already checks if the sk_rcvbuf is full and discards the packet in this 
case, so we don't need an internal rx_queue.

Maybe someday we should convert stream to skbuff too, it would make our 
lives easier.

Thanks,
Stefano
