FWIW, we're now very close to being able to validate dev->iommu against 
where the domain came from in core code, and so short-circuit 
->attach_dev entirely if they don't match. At that point -EINVAL at the 
driver callback level could be assumed to refer to the domain argument, 
while anything else could be taken as something going unexpectedly wrong 
when the attach may otherwise have worked. I've forgotten if we actually 
had a valid case anywhere for "this is my device but even if you retry 
with a different domain it's still never going to work", but I think we 
wouldn't actually need that anyway - it should be clear enough to a 
caller that if attaching to an existing domain fails, then allocating a 
fresh domain and attaching also fails, that's the point to give up.

Robin.
