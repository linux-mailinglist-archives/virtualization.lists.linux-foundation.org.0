No, PMEM should not be considered at all relative to whether to use MC
or not, it is 100% a decision of whether you expect virtiofs users
will balk more at unhandled machine checks or performance regressions
on the platforms that set "enable_copy_mc_fragile()". See
quirk_intel_brickland_xeon_ras_cap() and
quirk_intel_purley_xeon_ras_cap() in arch/x86/kernel/quirks.c.

I assume you meant "not like", but again PMEM has no bearing on
whether using that device will throw machine checks. I'm sure there
are people that would make the opposite tradeoff.
