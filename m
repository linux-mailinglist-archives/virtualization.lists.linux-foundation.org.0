I'm not sure the lines above look like a violation of the spec. If you
examine vhost_vsock_alloc_pkt() I believe that you will agree that:
len == pkt->len == pkt->hdr.len
which makes sense since according to the spec both tx and rx messages
are hdr+payload. And I believe hdr.len is the size of the payload,
although that does not seem to be properly documented by the spec.

On the other hand tx messages are stated to be device read-only (in the
spec) so if the device writes stuff, that is certainly wrong.

If that is what happens. 

Looking at virtqueue_get_buf_ctx_split() I'm not sure that is what
happens. My hypothesis is that we just a last descriptor is an 'in'
type descriptor (i.e. a device writable one). For tx that assumption
would be wrong.

I will have another look at this today and send a fix patch if my
suspicion is confirmed.

Thanks for the info! Then I will dig a little deeper. I asked in order
to avoid doing the debugging and fixing just to see that somebody was
faster :D

Thank you!
