I see, also vhost_dev_init() requires an array, so I agree that this is 
the best approach, sorry for the noise.

Just to be sure to check that anything is working if 
CONFIG_VHOST_VSOCK_DGRAM is defined, but the guest has an old driver 
that doesn't support DGRAM, and viceversa.

Mmm, I'm confused now. The statement says "If VIRTIO_VSOCK_F_MRG_RXBUF
is not negotiated"
    ^

Is it a typo?


IIUC when VIRTIO_VSOCK_F_MRG_RXBUF is negotiated the minimum buffer size 
is virtio_vsock_hdr_mgr_rxbuf...

... from this ^ statement.

And I agree that rx buf should be at least the virtio_vsock_hdr size.

Sorry about that. I generally always saw the present tense and seemed to
