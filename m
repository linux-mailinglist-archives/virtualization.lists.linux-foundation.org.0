Why not submit a Venus MR?  It's already in-tree, and you can see how your
API works in scenarios with a host side timeline semaphore (aka syncobj).
I think they are also interested in fencing/sync improvements.

Depends on your threading model.  You can have the following scenarios:

1) N guest contexts : 1 host thread
2) N guest contexts : N host threads for each context
3) 1:1 thread

I think the native context is single-threaded (1), IIRC?  If the goal is to
push command submission to the host (for inter-context sharing), I think
you'll at-least want (2).  For a 1:1 model (a la gfxstream), one host
thread can put another thread's out_sync_objs as it's in_sync_objs (in the
same virtgpu context).  I think that's kind of the goal of timeline
semaphores, with the example given by Khronos as with a compute thread + a
graphics thread.

I'm not saying one threading model is better than any other, perhaps the
native context using the host driver in the guest is so good, it doesn't
matter.  I'm just saying these are the types of discussions we can have if
we tried to get one the Mesa MRs merged first ;-)

Turnip would also fulfill the requirements, since most of the native
context stuff is already wired for freedreno.

Get it out of draft mode then :-).  How long would that take?

Also, there's crosvm which builds on standard Linux, so I wouldn't consider
QEMU patches as a requirement.  Just Mesa/virglrenderer part.

You can think of my commentary as the following suggestions:

- You can probably get native contexts and deqp-vk 1.2 working with the
current UAPI
- It would be terrific to see inter-context fence sharing working (with the
wait pushed down to the host), that's something the current UAPI can't do
- Work iteratively (i.e, it's fine to merge Mesa/virglrenderer MRs as
"experimental") and in steps, no need to figure everything out at once

Now these are just suggestions, and while I think they are good, you can
safely ignore them.

But there's also the DRM requirements, which state "userspace side must be
fully reviewed and tested to the standards of that user-space project.".
So I think to meet the minimum requirements, I think we should at-least
have one of the following (not all, just one) reviewed:

1) venus using the new uapi
2) gfxstream vk using the new uapi
3) amdgpu nctx out of "draft" mode and using the new uapi.
4) virtio-intel using new uapi
5) turnip using your new uapi

Depending on which one you chose, maybe we can get it done within 1-2 weeks=
?

I'm not opening MR for virtio-intel because it has open questions that
