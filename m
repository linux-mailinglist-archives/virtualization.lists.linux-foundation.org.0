The gpio-aggregator is running on the host...

... while the virtio-gpio driver is meant for the guest kernel.

I my PoC "[PATCH QEMU v2 0/5] Add a GPIO backend"[1], I didn't have
a virtio transport, but just hooked into the PL061 GPIO emulation
in QEMU.  The PL061 QEMU driver talked to the GPIO backend, which
talked to /dev/gpiochipN on the host.

So QEMU has to translate the virtio-gpio communication to e.g.
/dev/gpiochipN on the host (or a different backend on non-Linux or
bare-metal HV).

Can you please share a link to the QEMU patches?

The GPIO aggregator came into play after talking to Alexander Graf and
Peter Maydell.  To reduce the attack surface, they didn't want QEMU
to be responsible for exporting to the guest a subset of all GPIOs of
a gpiochip, only a full gpiochip.  However, the full gpiochip may
contain critical GPIOs you do not want the guest to tamper with.
Hence the GPIO aggregator was born, to take care of aggregating all
GPIOs you want to export to a guest into a new virtual gpiochip.

You can find more information about the GPIO Aggregator's use cases in
"[PATCH v7 0/6] gpio: Add GPIO Aggregator"[2].
