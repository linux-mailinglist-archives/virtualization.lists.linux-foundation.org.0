I think there is no need to have allocations/deallocations/memcpy for 
reqs[i].buf any more
if using msgs[i].buf directly.

The problem is that you can't guarantee that adap->algo->master_xfer is 
only called
from i2c_transfer. Any function who holds the adapter can call 
adap->algo->master_xfer
directly. So I think it is safer to have a lock in virtio_i2c_xfer.

Will try to use msgs[i].buf directly. So it should be no free bufs any more.
