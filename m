Can we get one of the Mesa MRs reviewed first?  There's currently no
virtio-intel MR AFAICT, and the amdgpu one is marked as "Draft:".

Even for the amdgpu, Pierre suggests the feature "will be marked as
experimental both in Mesa and virglrenderer" and we can revise as needed.
The DRM requirements seem to warn against adding an UAPI too hastily...

You can get the deqp-vk 1.2 tests to pass with the current UAPI, if you
just change your mesa <--> virglrenderer protocol a little.  Perhaps that
way is even better, since you plumb the in sync-obj into host-side command
submission.

Without inter-context sharing of the fence, this MR really only adds guest
kernel syntactic sugar.

Note I'm not against syntactic sugar, but I just want to point out that you
can likely merge the native context work without any UAPI changes, in case
it's not clear.

If this was for the core drm syncobj implementation, and not just

There are several possible and viable paths to get the features in question
(VK1.2 syncobjs, and inter-context fence sharing).  There are paths
entirely without the syncobj, paths that only use the syncobj for the
inter-context fence sharing case and create host syncobjs for VK1.2, paths
that also use guest syncobjs in every proxied command submission.

It's really hard to tell which one is better.  Here's my suggestion:

1) Get the native contexts reviewed/merged in Mesa/virglrenderer using the
current UAPI.  Options for VK1.2 include: pushing down the syncobjs to the
host, and simulating the syncobj (as already done).  It's fine to mark
these contexts as "experimental" like msm-experimental.  That will allow
you to experiment with the protocols, come up with tests, and hopefully
determine an answer to the host versus guest syncobj question.

2) Once you've completed (1), try to add UAPI changes for features that are
missing or things that are suboptimal with the knowledge gained from doing
(2).

WDYT?
