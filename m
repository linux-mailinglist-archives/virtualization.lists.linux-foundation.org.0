I had been doing some performance benchmarking for virtiofs and I found
some old results.

https://github.com/rhvgoyal/virtiofs-tests/tree/master/performance-results/feb-10-2021

While running on top of local fs, with bs=4K, with single queue I could
achieve more than 600MB/s.

NAME                    WORKLOAD                Bandwidth       IOPS            
default                 seqread-psync           625.0mb         156.2k          
no-tpool                seqread-psync           660.8mb         165.2k          

But catch here I think is that host is doing the caching. In your
case I am assuming there is no caching at DPU and all the I/O is
going to remote storage (which might be doing caching in memory).

Anyway, point I am trying to make is that even with single vq, virtiofs
can push a reasonable amount of I/O.

I will be cuirous to find how multiqueue can improve these numbers
further.

I am wondering how did you conclude that single vq is the bottleneck for
performance and not the remote storage DPU is sending I/O to.
