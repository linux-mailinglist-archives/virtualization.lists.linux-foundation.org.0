Agreed.  There were reasons we decided to present pmem as "block
device with extra functionality" rather than try to cram all the block
layer functionality (eg submitting BIOs for filesystem metadata) into a
character device.  Some of those assumptions might be worth re-examining,
but I haven't seen anything that makes me say "this is obviously better
than what we did at the time".
