Hmmm, I guess you mean switchdev mode with external learning bridge 
software e.g. Open vSwitch? It's conceptionally the same with device 
internal learning bridge, no?

OK, though the point was that QEMU should anyway notify the backend of 
the mac address change for vDPA driver to apply the new MAC filter, 
similar to the way how CTRL_MAC ctrl_vq command is doing. It should not 
blindly assume that the every vDPA hardware may have underlying learning 
bridge construct, being internal or external. Basically it's not a 
universal assumption on the existence of learning bridge, this won't 
work for any other vDPA NIC without switchdev or learning bridge.

Sorry I don't get what you mean here, but I guess we may talk about 
different thing here (it seems you talked about trusted model that 
allows any MAC address, but it's orthogonal to programming MAC address 
filter to the underlying hardware as far as I understand).

It looks like we may have misunderstood each other - that's exactly the 
point I want to make. The persistent mac address provisioned in dst by 
the mgmt software should stay the same with that on src, which is the 
default mac address rather than whatever other (temporary) mac address 
the VM might be using at the time of migration switchover at the source.

Right, this is exactly the way our mgmt software works.

This seems like a bug of libvirt. For our case, we strictly prohibit 
unequal MTU on src & dst to work. Even migrating from MTU 1500 to 4000, 
it effectively changes the underlying behavior for packet dropping and 
network setup at which maximum size the packet should be allowed when 
entering the VM.

Regardless of XML being a good interface or not for end users, but I 
don't see how it relates to the issue here i.e. conflict/ambiguity or 
extra validation in the (kernel) code.

I don't see how this can be re-used by QEMU as QMP is not 
taking/exporting XML. Are we talking about libvirt here, which happens 
to be one amongst many others? My personal feeling is that not quite a 
lot of human end users (rather than management software or script) today 
would prefer using XML. Instead, like any other iproute utility, json 
seems to a more popular interface for script and mgmt software to 
consume, which vdpa tool supports natively already.

I think basically we can support two set of CLI interfaces, one friendly 
enough for human users, and another scriptable and parseable by 
management software users. IMO for now we should start to focus on the 
human oriented CLI design first. Whether XML v.s. json being an ideal 
interface for managment software would be another discussion that would 
need more inputs from the broader range of extended community, which is 
not worth distracting from.

Let me get some time to implement and post the relevant patches (mostly 
in iproute) later. Basically this would supplement those config 
attributes introduced through the 'vdpa dev show' series below [1] with

            this <br>
            &quot;dev_features&quot; attr in &quot;mgmtdev show&quot; command output should
            have been <br>
            called &quot;supported_features&quot; in the first place. <br>
            <br>
            Not sure I get this, but I guess this is the negotiated
            features actually. <br>
            <br>
            Actually no, that is why I said the name is a bit confusing
            and &quot;supported_features&quot; might sound better. <br>
            <br>
            You're right, it's an mgmtdev show actually. <br>
            <br>
            This attribute in the parent device (mgmtdev) denotes the
            real device capability for what virtio features can be
            supported by the parent device. Any unprivileged user can
            check into this field to know parent device's capability
            without having to create a child vDPA device at all. The
            features that child vDPA device may support should be a
            subset of, or at most up to what the parent device offers.
            For e.g. the vdpa device dev1 you created below can expose
            less or equal device_features bit than 0x308820028 (MTU MAC
            CTRL_VQ CTRL_MAC_ADDR ANY_LAYOUT VERSION_1 ACCESS_PLATFORM),
            but shouldn't be no more than what the parent device can
            actually support. <br>
            <br>
            Yes, I didn't see anything wrong with &quot;dev_features&quot;, <br>
            <br>
            Yep, it didn't appear to me anything wrong either at first
            sight, then I gave my R-b on the series introduced this
            attribute. But it's not a perfect name, either, on the other
            hand. Parav later pointed out that the corresponding enum
            definition for this attribute should follow pre-existing
            naming convention that we should perhaps do
            s/VDPA_ATTR_DEV_SUPPORTED_FEATURES/VDPA_ATTR_MGMTDEV_SUPPORTED_FEATURES/
            to get it renamed, as this is a mgmtdev level attribute,
            which I agree. Now that with the upcoming &quot;device_features&quot;
            attribute (vdpa dev level) from this series, it's subject to
            another confusions between these two similar names, but
            actually would represent things at different level. While
            all other attributes in &quot;mgmtdev dev show&quot; seem to be
            aligned with the &quot;supported_&quot; prefix, e.g.
            supported_classes, max_supported_vqs, from which I think the
            stance of device is already implied through &quot;mgmtdev&quot; in the
            command. For the perspective of clarify and easy
            distinction, &quot;supported_features&quot; seems to be a better name
            than &quot;dev_features&quot;. <br>

          See another reply, I think I get your point, <br>

            We need some changes in the vdpa tool to show

            unconditionally in the &quot;dev config show&quot; command. <br>
            <br>
            That's true, I think I ever pointed it out to Lingshan
            before, that it's not needed to bother exposing those config
            space fields in &quot;dev config show&quot; output, if the only intent
            is for live migration of device features between nodes. For
            vDPA live migration, what cares most is those configuration
            parameters specified on vdpa creation, and userspace VMM
            (QEMU) is supposed to take care of saving and restoring live
            device states. I think it's easier to extend &quot;vdpa dev show&quot;
            output to include device_features and other config params as
            well, rather than count on validity of various config space
            fields. <br>
          </blockquote>
          Probably, but for the migration it's more about the ability of
          the <br>
          mgmtdev instead of the vDPA device itself I think. <br>
        </blockquote>
        If picking the appropriate device for migration is what it is
        concerned, it's subject to the capability that mgmtdev offers.
        That's true, for sure. <br>
        <br>
        On the other hand, mgmt software would also need to take care of
        reconstructing the destination device with the same
        configuration as that at the source side. For example, a mgmtdev
        on source supports features A, B, C, D,&nbsp; and destination mgmtdev
        supports features B, C, D, E. When vdpa device on the source is
        initially created with features B and C but without feature D
        (noted: creation with a subset of mgmtdev features was already
        supported before, and this series just makes it more explicit),
        the mgmt software is supposed to equally create a device with
        features B and C on dest, even though the destination may
        support feature D that the mgmtdev on both sides can support. My
        point is, we should have some flexibility on the mgmt software
        implementation that allows the mgmt software to easily tell
        apart the exact features (i.e. B and C in the above example) and
        the exact configuration a specific vdpa device was originally
        created with, via some simple query command. Having mgmt
        software to remember the vdpa creation args could work, but on
        the other hand it'd be nice to allow lightweight software
        implementation without having to persist the list of vdpa args
        and make vdpa tool more self-contained. <br>
        <br>
        I will post a patch (series) shortly to demonstrate this idea.
        Basically, there's no actual need to mess around with those
        config space values for live migration. It was not built for
        that purpose. <br>

            instance, MAC address in config space can be changed

        Noted I think here we are still talking about VERSION_1 device
        which is spec conforming. So far as I understand the spec, if
        the VIRTIO_NET_F_CTRL_MAC feature is not negotiated, there's no
        way for driver to change the default MAC address. <br>

        Even if we want to simulate or support a legacy device model,

        change the MAC address filter underneath. I don't see that it
        ever happens in today's code, so I presume the only possibility
        this may work is that the specific vDPA device may have an
        internal learning bridge that adapts to what MAC address the
        driver actually sends. </blockquote>
      <br>
      <br>
      This is not true AFAIK. E.g when switchdev is enabled for mlx5
      parent. <br>
    </blockquote>
    Hmmm, I guess you mean switchdev mode with external learning bridge
    software e.g. Open vSwitch? It's conceptionally the same with device
    internal learning bridge, no? <br>
    <br>
    OK, though the point was that QEMU should anyway notify the backend
    of the mac address change for vDPA driver to apply the new MAC
    filter, similar to the way how CTRL_MAC ctrl_vq command is doing. It
    should not blindly assume that the every vDPA hardware may have
    underlying learning bridge construct, being internal or external.
    Basically it's not a universal assumption on the existence of
    learning bridge, this won't work for any other vDPA NIC without
    switchdev or learning bridge.<br>

    Sorry I don't get what you mean here, but I guess we may talk about

    It looks like we may have misunderstood each other - that's exactly
    the point I want to make. The persistent mac address provisioned in
    dst by the mgmt software should stay the same with that on src,
    which is the default mac address rather than whatever other
    (temporary) mac address the VM might be using at the time of
    migration switchover at the source.<br>

    This seems like a bug of libvirt. For our case, we strictly prohibit
    unequal MTU on src &amp; dst to work. Even migrating from MTU 1500

          Two ways: <br>
          <br>
          1) mgmtdev should show the mac table size so mgmt layer can
          provision <br>
          the mac table size <br>
          2) If the mac table exceeds what is supported in the
          destination, it <br>
          needs to enable the all uni in this case. <br>
        </blockquote>
        Yep, so no field in the config space can help with these two
        solutions, right? MAC table size is not showing up there.
        Whether the parent device supports ALLUNI via
        VIRTIO_NET_F_CTRL_RX is not there, either. (showing them in the
        'vdpa mgmtdev show' output is the right thing IMHO). <br>

            the opposite case, the destination device should be created
            with equally same mandatory device features, which only vDPA
            creation parameters should matter. While I can't think of a

            Lingshan, could you please share your thoughts or patch on
            this? <br>
            <br>
            Noted here the device_features argument specified during
            vdpa creation is introduced by this series itself, it
            somehow slightly changed the original semantics of what
            device_features used to be. <br>
            <br>
            I'm not sure I get this, we don't support device_features in
            the past <br>
            and it is used to provision device features to the vDPA
            device which <br>
            seems to be fine. <br>
            <br>
            Before this change, only look at the dev_features in
            &quot;mgmtdev show&quot; and remember creation parameters is
            sufficient to get to all needed info for creating vDPA at
            destination. <br>
          </blockquote>
          Note that even with the same vendor, mgmtdev may support
          different features. <br>
          <br>
          <blockquote type="cite">After this change, dev_features in
            &quot;mgmtdev show&quot; becomes less relevant, as it would need to

            migration, it would complicate the implementation of mgmt
            software, on the other hand. <br>
          </blockquote>
          To allow cross vendor live migration I couldn't find a better
          way. <br>
        </blockquote>
        The idea itself is great, I think, though the CLI interface may
        have some space for improvement. For example, user has to supply
        the heximal value consisting of each feature bit, which is a bit
        challenging for normal users who are not super familiar with
        each virtio feature. On the other hand, there could be ambiguity
        against other vdpa create option, e.g. users may do &quot;vdpa dev
        add name vdpa0 mgmtdev ... mtu 1500 device_features 0x300020000&quot;
        (no F_MTU feature bit in device_features) that needs special
        validation in the code. <br>

      We can accept e.g XML in the future I think. <br>
    </blockquote>
    Regardless of XML being a good interface or not for end users, but I
    don't see how it relates to the issue here i.e. conflict/ambiguity

        How about we follow the CPU flags model or QEMU virtio-net-pci

        the current convention for each &quot;vdpa dev add&quot; option implies
        that the corresponding feature bit will be enabled once
        specified in creation. Similarly we can introduce additional

    </blockquote>
    I don't see how this can be re-used by QEMU as QMP is not
    taking/exporting XML. Are we talking about libvirt here, which
    happens to be one amongst many others? My personal feeling is that
    not quite a lot of human end users (rather than management software
    or script) today would prefer using XML. Instead, like any other
    iproute utility, json seems to a more popular interface for script
    and mgmt software to consume, which vdpa tool supports natively
    already.<br>
    <br>
    I think basically we can support two set of CLI interfaces, one
    friendly enough for human users, and another scriptable and
    parseable by management software users. IMO for now we should start
    to focus on the human oriented CLI design first. Whether XML v.s.
    json being an ideal interface for managment software would be
    another discussion that would need more inputs from the broader
    range of extended community, which is not worth distracting from.<br>

            When simply look at the &quot;vdpa dev config show&quot; output, I
            cannot really <br>
            tell the actual device_features that was used in vdpa
            creation. For e.g. <br>
            there is a missing feature ANY_LAYOUT from
            negotiated_features compared <br>
            with supported_features in mgmtdev, but the orchestration
            software <br>
            couldn't tell if the vdpa device on destination host should
            be created <br>
            with or without the ANY_LAYOUT feature. <br>
            <br>
            I think VERSION_1 implies ANY_LAYOUT. <br>
            <br>
            Right, ANY_LAYOUT is a bad example. A good example might be
            that, I knew the parent mgmtdev on migration source node
            supports CTRL_MAC_ADDR, but I don't find it in
            negotiated_features. <br>
            <br>
            I think we should use the features that we got from &quot;mgmtdev

            instead of &quot;negotiated features&quot;. <br>
            <br>
            That was how it's supposed to work previously, but with this
            series, I think the newly introduced device_features will be
            needed instead of the one in &quot;mgmtdev show&quot;. <br>
          </blockquote>
          Just to clarify, there won't be a device_features in mgmtdev
          show <br>
          since it is device specific, each individual device can have
          its own <br>
          device features which are subset of what is supported by the
          mgmtdev. <br>
        </blockquote>
        Yep. <br>
        <blockquote type="cite"> <br>
          <blockquote type="cite"> <br>
            On the migration destination node, the parent device does
            support all features as the source offers, including
            CTRL_MAC_ADDR. What device features you would expect the
            mgmt software to create destination vdpa device with, if not
            otherwise requiring mgmt software to remember all the
            arguments on device creation? <br>
          </blockquote>
          So the provisioning in the destination should use exactly the
          same <br>
          device_feautres as what the vdpa device has in the source. But
          before <br>
          this, management layer should guarantee to provision a vDPA
          device <br>
          whose device_features can be supported on the destination in
          order to <br>
          allow live migration. <br>
        </blockquote>
        Exactly. <br>
        <blockquote type="cite"> <br>
          <blockquote type="cite">So in this example, we need use
            &quot;dev_features&quot; so we get exact the <br>
            same features after and operation as either src or dst. <br>
            <br>
            If the device_features vDPA created with at the source
            doesn't include CTRL_MAC_ADDR even though parent supports
            it, then the vDPA to be created at the destination shouldn't

            However, if just taking look at negotiated_features, some
            mgmt software implementations which don't persist the

            &nbsp; But it should be sufficient to <br>
            use features_src &amp; feature_dst in this case. Actually,
            it should work <br>
            similar as to the cpu flags, the management software should
            introduce <br>
            the concept of cluster which means the maximal set of common
            features <br>
            is calculated and provisioned during device creation to
            allow <br>
            migration among the nodes inside the cluster. <br>
            <br>
            Yes, this is one way mgmt software may implement, but I am
            not sure if it's the only way. For e.g. for cpu flags, mgmt
            software can infer the guest cpus features in use from all
            qemu command line arguments and host cpu
            features/capability, which doesn't need to remember creation
            arguments and is easy to recover from failure without having
            to make the VM config persistent in data store. I thought it
            would be great if vdpa CLI design could offer the same. <br>
            <br>
            One minor difference is that we have cpu model abstraction,
            so we can <br>
            have things like: <br>
            <br>
            ./qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu EPYC <br>
            <br>
            Which implies the cpu features/flags where vDPA doesn't
            have. But <br>
            consider it's just a 64bit (or 128 in the future), it
            doesn't seems to <br>
            be too complex for the management to know, we probably need
            to start <br>
            from this and then we can try to introduce some
            generation/model after <br>
            it is agreed on most of the vendors. <br>
            <br>
            What you refer to is the so-called named model for CPU
            flags. I think it's a good addition to have some generation
            or named model defined for vDPA. But I don't get the point
            for how it relates to exposing the actual value of device
            features? Are you saying in this case you'd rather expose
            the model name than the actual value of feature bits? Well,
            I think we can expose both in different fields when there's
            really such a need. <br>
          </blockquote>
          It's something like: <br>
          <br>
          vdpa dev add name dev1 mgmtdev vdpasim_net device_features
          VDPA_NET_MODEL_1 <br>
          <br>
          and VDPA_NET_MODEL_1 implies some feature sets. <br>
        </blockquote>
        <br>
        Not sure if this could be very useful for virtio devices, given
        we don't have a determined set of virtio features unlike CPU
        generation/model, but I think even with the features_default
        property we can still achieve that. <br>
