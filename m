Sure, but that's the case for patches that get mainlined (and
subsequently backported to -stable) /after/ this update to the
MAINTAINERS file gets merged into mainline.

When adding the CC stable tag, the case I was trying to address was
for patches that are already in mainline but weren't CC'ed to stable,
and at some later point, somebody decides to backport them to older
stable kernels. In that case, there is a chance that the contributor
might run ./get_maintainer.pl against the stable tree (as that's the
tree they are backporting the upstream commit against) and end up not
CC'ing the new maintainers. So, I thought it would be good to keep the
maintainer info updated in the older stable kernels too.

Srivatsa
