Yep, I think so, we need to implement it before adding a new transport
that can support dgram.

Yep, I think so. Although in vsock_dgram_connect we call lock_sock(), so 
maybe that could be enough to protect us.

In general I think we should use vsk->transport if vsock_dgram_connect()
is called, or we need to do per-packet lookup.

Another think I would change, is the dgram_dequeue() callback.
I would remove it, and move in the core the code in 
vmci_transport_dgram_dequeue() since it seems pretty generic.

This should work well if every transport uses sk_receive_skb() to 
enqueue sk_buffs in the socket buffer.

Thanks,
Stefano
