If it is shared, then what does this mean?  Do we then need to copy
everything out of that buffer first before doing anything with it
because the data could change later on?  Or do we not trust anything in
it at all and we throw it away?  Or something else (trust for a short
while and then we don't?)

Please be specific as to what you want to see happen here, and why.
