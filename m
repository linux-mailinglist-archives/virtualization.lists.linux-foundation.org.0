I'll let John comment on that. But from what I understood, in most 
setups where ZONE_MOVABLE gets used for hotplugged memory 
offline_and_remove_memory() succeeds and allows for reusing the device 
later without a reboot.

For the cases where it doesn't work, a reboot is required.

virtio-mem, in default operation, does that: use alloc_contig_range() to 
logically unplug ("fake offline") that memory and then just trigger 
offline_and_remove_memory() to make it "officially offline".

In that mode, offline_and_remove_memory() cannot really timeout and is 
almost always going to succeed (except memory notifiers and some hugetlb 
dissolving).

Right now we also allow the admin to configure ordinary offlining 
directly (without prior fake offlining) when bigger memory blocks are 
used: offline_pages() is more reliable than alloc_contig_range(), for 
example, because it disables the PCP and the LRU cache, and retries more 
often (well, unfortunately then also forever). It has a higher chance of 
succeeding especially when bigger blocks of memory are offlined+removed.

Maybe we should make the alloc_contig_range()-based mechanism more 
configurable and make it the only mode in virtio-mem, such that we don't 
have to mess with offline_and_remove_memory() endless loops -- at least 
for virtio-mem.

 From what I understood if offline_and_remove_memory() succeeded, the 
device can be reinitialized and used again. Otherwise, a reboot is 
required because that memory is still added to the system.

Thanks Michal!
