Yep, I think the easiest way is to add a parameter to vhost_vsock_stop() 
to tell when to call vhost_dev_check_owner() or not.  This is because 
dev->mm is protected by dev->mutex, acquired in vhost_vsock_stop().

I will send a patch right away, it would be great if you can review.

Thanks,
Stefano
