Please note that early allocation, most importantly the memmap,
are not accounted to MemTotal. This memory is similarly not managed
by the buddy. (thus the name adjust_managed_page_count())

But yes, there will always be some memory that will be accounted to
MemTotal that can never get freed. With memory ballooning it can easily
be in the range of gigabytes.

Please note that the hyper-v balloon just recently switched to using
adjust_managed_page_count() proper accounting reasons:

    hv_balloon: do adjust_managed_page_count() when ballooning/un-ballooning
    
    Unlike virtio_balloon/virtio_mem/xen balloon drivers, Hyper-V balloon driver
    does not adjust managed pages count when ballooning/un-ballooning and this leads
    to incorrect stats being reported, e.g. unexpected 'free' output.
    
    Note, the calculation in post_status() seems to remain correct: ballooned out
    pages are never 'available' and we manually add dm->num_pages_ballooned to
    'commited'.

Not quite. There are hypervisors that add more memory using
DIMMs (and as far as I heard virtio-mem) when required but
always fake-unplug memory using virtio-balloon.

So what you actually want to expose to user space is the initial VM size.
We cannot reliably say what the maximum in the future will be
(memory hotplug), it can even be lower than the initial VM size. So it's
a pure heuristic after all.

I disagree. Libvirt adds virtio-balloon as default to each and every VM.
Some people use virtiio-balloon to logically unplug memory, to eventually
never hotplug it again.

Well, I would say that :) The hyper-v balloon is a good example, and the
xen balloon also hotplugs actual memory on demand. And it's
becoming more popular in the virtio world with virtio-mem as well
(which some cloud providers already support).

Don't get me wrong, I am absolutely not a fan of deflate-on-oom. I think
it was a mistake, but apparently, there are some actual users.

I'd appreciate a more generic approach for user space to figure out the
"initial memory size" in a virtualized environment than adding
some module parameter to virtio-balloon -- if that makes sense.

MemTotal as is expresses how much memory the buddy currently manages,
for example, excluding early allocations during boot, excluding actually
unplugged memory and excluding logically unplugged memory. Adjusting that
value makes perfect sense for virtio-balloon without deflate-on-oom.

Instead of changing MemTotal semantics, I'd say we introduce some other
mechanism to figure out the initial VM size -- "logically offline" memory
is just an example. "MemMax" might be misleading and easily wrong.
"MemInitial" might be an feasible option.

Yes, some special user space applications would have to be adjusted.

The issue is that any application that relies on MemTotal in a virtualized
environment is most probably already suboptimal in some cases. You can
rely on it and actually later someone will unplug (inflate balloon)
memory or plug (deflate balloon) memory. Even MemAvailable is suboptimal
because what about two applications that rely on that information at
the same time?
