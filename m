I don't fundamentally hate the patchset.  I do have concerns about
the completely broken patch.

With respect this patchset my gut says decide.  Are you a thread of the
process (just use create_io_worker) are you a separate process forked
from the caller (use a cousin of create_io_worker but don't touch
create_io_worker).  I think being a process vs being a thread is such a
fundamental difference we don't want to mix the helpers.

I think 3 staying in the callers nproc strongly suggests you want to
reuse copy_process.  Which gets back to my question do you want
a thread or do you want a process.


For me a key detail is what is the lifetime of the vhost device?

Does the vhost go away when the caller goes away?

  If so you can create a thread in the caller's process that only performs
  work in kernel space.  At which point you are essentially
  create_io_thread.

If the vhost device can live after the caller goes away how is that managed?
  Especially when you are tied to the caller's mm.

  If your device lives on after the caller then you should be a separate
  process forked from the caller.

Like I said.  I don't hate this patchset.  I think you just tried to be
a little too general.


With kthreads you are fighting very hard to get something that is not
part of the process tree to act like it is part of the process tree.
Which strongly suggests you should be part of the process tree.

As long as you don't have important state you will need to fight to get
separate from the process.

If you do have important state that needs to not come from the process
figuring out how to make a kthread work may be safer.

I don't currently know vhost devices well enough to answer that question.

I hope this gives you some useful direction.
