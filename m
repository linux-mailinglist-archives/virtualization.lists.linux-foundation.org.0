Yes, it's not specific to vDPA but something that openstack needs to consider.

A migration compatibility check for vDPA should be done as well here.

Basic shadow vq based live migration can work now. Eugenio is working
to make it fully ready in the near future.

I agree.

So a question here, if we need to create vDPA on demand (e.g with the
features and configs from the source) who will do the provision? Is it
libvirt?
