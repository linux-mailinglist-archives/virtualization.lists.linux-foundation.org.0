Taking a step back for perspective.

I think there's broad consensus in moving the parameter to drm, naming
the check function to drm_something_something(), and breaking the ties
to CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE. I appreciate the work you're doing to that
effect.

I think everything beyond that is still a bit vague and/or
contentious. So how about making the first 2-3 patches just that?
Something we can all agree on, makes good progress, improves the kernel,
and gives us something to build on?

BR,
Jani.
