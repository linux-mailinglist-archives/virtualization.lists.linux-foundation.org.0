Nonsense it already works.

But I did not ask about the future since I do not believe it
can be confidently predicted. I asked what is missing in VDPA
now for you to add this feature there and not in VFIO.

yea, VDPA does trap and emulate for config accesses.  which is exactly
what this patch does?  so why does it belong in vfio muddying up its
passthrough model is beyond me, except that apparently there's some
specific deployment that happens to use vfio so now whatever
that deployment needs has to go into vfio whether it belongs there or not.
