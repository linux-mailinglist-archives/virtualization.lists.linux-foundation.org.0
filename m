So here we go, its of course artificial, but still:

	1. #VC happens, not important where
	2. NMI in the #VC prologue before it moved off its IST stack
	   - first VC IST adjustment happening here
	3. #VC in the NMI handler
	4. #HV in the #VC prologue again
	   - second VC IST adjustment happening here, so the #HV handler
	     can cause its own #VC exceptions.

Can only happen if the #HV handler is allowed to cause #VC exceptions.
But even if its not allowed, it can happen with SNP and a malicious
Hypervisor. But in this case the only option is to reliably panic.

I wasn't aware that it is 4k in size now. I still thought it was just
these 64 words large and one can not simply execute C code on it.

Right, thanks for pointing this out.

Yeah, I was just being cautious. The explicit alignment can be removed,
Boris also pointed this out.

No, you don't miss anything here. At the moment #VC can't happen at
those places, so this is not handled yet. With SNP it can happen and
needs to be handled in a way to at least allow a reliable panic (because
if it really happens the Hypervisor is messing with us).

Yes, I havn't looked at the details yet, but if a #VC happens there it
probably better not returns.

Yes, a malicious Hypervisor can do that, and without #HV there is no
real protection against this besides turning all vectors (even IRQs)
into paranoid entries. Maybe even more care is needed, but I think its
not worth to care about this.

Turning off SCE might be tempting, but I guess doing so would break a
quite some user-space code, no?
