The device may poll for transmit completions as a result of an interrupt
from virtnet_poll_tx.

As well as asynchronously to this transmit interrupt, from start_xmit or
from virtnet_poll_cleantx as a result of a receive interrupt.

As of napi-tx, transmit interrupts are left enabled to operate in standard
napi mode. While previously they would be left disabled for most of the
time, enabling only when the queue as low on descriptors.

(in practice, for the at the time common case of split ring with event index,
little changed, as that mode does not actually enable/disable the interrupt,
but looks at the consumer index in the ring to decide whether to interrupt)

Combined, this may cause the following:

1. device sends a packet and fires transmit interrupt
2. driver cleans interrupts using virtnet_poll_cleantx
3. driver handles transmit interrupt using vring_interrupt,
    detects that the vring is empty: !more_used(vq),
    and records a spurious interrupt.

I don't quite follow how suppressing interrupt suppression, i.e.,
skipping disable_cb, helps avoid this.

I'm probably missing something. Is this solving a subtly different
problem from the one as I understand it?
