Same for upper layers :)  The just do abstract operations that can sit
on top of a variety of drivers.

Which assumes that:

 a) a DMA mapping needs to be done at all
 b) it can be done using a struct device exposed to it
 c) that DMA mapping is actually at the same granularity that it
    operates on

all of which might not be true.

Yes,  For actual hardware virtio and some more complex virtualized
setups it works just like real hardware.  For legacy virtio there is 
no DMA maping involved at all.  Because of that all DMA mapping needs
to be done inside of virtio.

FYI, dma_map_* is not intended for long term mappings, can lead
to starvation issues.  You need to use dma_alloc_* instead.  And
"you" in that case is as I said the driver, not an upper layer.
If it's just helper called by drivers and never from core code,
that's of course fine.
