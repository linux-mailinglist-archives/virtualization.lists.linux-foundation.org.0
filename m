Uhm... I proposed this initially with the goal of remove non fuctional
changes from a patch that was hard to digest for me (4/4). So it's
about diffstat to me ;) 

On the flip side the change suggested would probably not be as
straighforward as I would hope for.

The specific names used are not much relevant.

I feel like this series is potentially dangerous, but I could not spot
bugs into the code. I would have felt more relaxed eariler in the devel
cycle.
