What we're protecting is PageOffline() below. If I didn't mess up, we 
should always be calling page_offline_freeze() before calling 
PageOffline(). Or am I missing something?

Yes, I played with something like that. We'd have to handle the first 
page_offline_freeze() freeze differently, though, and that's where 
things got a bit ugly in my attempts.

No, the buffer size is also size_t and gets incremented on a per-byte 
basis. The variant I have right now looked the cleanest to me. Happy to 
hear simpler alternatives.
