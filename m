Ah, I see. Thank you, Peter!

Agreed.

I think using the BIT() macro still provides a nice readability
improvement. So, Shreenidhi, could you spin a new version of the patch
with the same code changes but with a different commit message about
using the BIT() macro to simplify the code, and also include a
clarification as to why the existing code is correct (which Peter
pointed out), please?

Thank you!
