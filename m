Hi Guennadi,

Sorry for the late reply and thanks for your comments, they helped me a
lot! Please see my answers inline.

It was a copy-paste mistake, I will edit these lines.

Yes, you are right here. I didn't notice that devm_kfree() now works
fine with NULL argument too.

Here, the reason for explicitly freeing managed resources is in the
current device reset handling logic. At the moment, executing the reset
worker results in a call to virtsnd_disable_vqs. After which the device
is recreated. And since in this case the driver is not detached from the
device, the managed resources are not automatically freed. On the other
hand, managed resources allow not to worry about deallocation if the
probing function returns an error.

No :)

I'm also wondering what the virtio people have to say. This part is a
purely virtio specific thing. And since none of the existing virtio
drivers processes the request to reset the device, it is not clear what
is the best way to proceed here. For this reason, the most
straightforward and simple solution was chosen.
