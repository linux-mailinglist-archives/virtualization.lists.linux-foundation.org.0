But that user space also has no idea "when" that memory will become
available, it could be never. This problem is similar to memory hotplug,
where we don't know "when" more memory might get hotplugged.

With deflate-on-OOM this behavior makes sense, because the guest can use
that memory whenever it wants -- it's actually available as soon as we
need it.

What about simply exposing the number of inflated balloon pages
("logically offline pages") e.g., via /proc/meminfo to user space? It's
then up to smart user space trying to be smart about memory that's not
available right now and might never become available eventually in the
future -- but still that user space wants to optimize for some eventuality.
