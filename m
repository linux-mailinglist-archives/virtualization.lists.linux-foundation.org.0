I was thinking of this one:

 1. device is sending packets
 2. driver cleans them at the same time using virtnet_poll_cleantx
 3. device fires transmit interrupts
 4. driver handles transmit interrupts using vring_interrupt,
     detects that the vring is empty: !more_used(vq),
     and records spurious interrupts.


but even yours is also fixed I think.

The common point is that a single spurious interrupt is not a problem.
The problem only exists if there are tons of spurious interrupts with no
real ones. For this to trigger, we keep polling the ring and while we do
device keeps firing interrupts. So just disable interrupts while we
poll.
