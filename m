Well, as you see, this is a v6 only of this patch set, and apart from it 
there have been several side discussions and patch sets.

I'm implementing a counterpart to the rpmsg protocol over VirtIO as 
initially implemented by drivers/rpmsg/virtio_rpmsg_bus.c for the "main 
CPU" (in case of remoteproc over VirtIO) or the guest side in case of 
Linux virtualisation. Since my implementation can talk to that driver, 
I don't think, that I'm inventing a new protocol. I'm adding support 
for the same protocol for the opposite side of the VirtIO divide.

As I replied to Vincent, I understand his proposal and the approach taken 
in the series [3], but I'm not sure I agree, that adding yet another 
virtual device / driver layer on the vhost side is a good idea. As far as 
I understand adding new completely virtual devices isn't considered to be 
a good practice in the kernel. Currently vhost is just a passive "library" 
and my vhost-rpmsg support keeps it that way. Not sure I'm in favour of 
converting vhost to a virtual device infrastructure.

Thanks for pointing me out at [3], I should have a better look at it.

Thanks
Guennadi
