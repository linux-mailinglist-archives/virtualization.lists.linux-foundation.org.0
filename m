Hi Jason,

> If I was not wrong, this value seems doesn't change. If yes, I wonder we
> can move the kick_offset logic to snet_alloc_dev()?


There is not a real reason to have this logic in snet_set_vq_address,
so it could be moved to snet_build_vqs (which is called within
snet_alloc_dev).

> -EOPNOTSUPP?


Returning an error from the set_vq_state callback leads to probe failure.
This code is taken from drivers/virtio/virtio_vdpa.c,
virtio_vdpa_setup_vq function:

>  struct vdpa_vq_state state = {0};
>
> ......
>
> err = ops->set_vq_state(vdpa, index, &state);
> if (err)
>         goto err_vq;


I could check struct vdpa_vq_state, and return 0 if struct
vdpa_vq_state value is 0, -EOPNOTSUPP otherwise.
What do you think?

You're right, I'll add a proper reset callback.

Usually reads are slow, but we don't care about speed when sending
messages (since we only send a "destroy" message so far, meaning that
the pci remove callback was called), so the memory barrier can be
replaced with a read operation.

Yes, I'll add it.

I'm not sure about that.
The endianness appears to be handled by the caller.

I'm not sure how the endianness can be handled by the vDPA driver.
This function may be called for a 8bit, 16bit, 32bit or 64bit variables.
It theoretically may be called to change multiple variables at once.
It may be called to change part of a variable.

I'll delete the snet_get_iova_range function.

Ok, I'll do it.

Good idea, I'll implement the wait & timeout.

You're right, this isn't required, I'll remove it.

All vDPA devices indeed use the same DMA device, there is no isolation
between the devices.
I'm not sure why there should be isolation in this case.

We want to leave control to the DPU at the moment, the number/type of
devices is determined by the DPU's config, and can't be controlled
from userspace.

You're right, the vdpa registration should be done after the
master/drvdata is set.

You're right, this isn't required, I'll remove it.

These are the negotiated features
We're not keeping record of the driver features, when
set_driver_features is called, we just logic AND the driver features
with the supported features received from the DPU.
I'll rename it to be 'negotiated_features", this seems more accurate.

You're right, I'll remove it.


Thank you for your comments.
I'll send a new version once I finish working on the comments.
