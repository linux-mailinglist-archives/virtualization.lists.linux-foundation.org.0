The budget here is broken. When I put the budget in page reporting it
was so that we wouldn't try to report all of the memory in a given
region. It is meant to hold us to no more than one pass through 1/16
of the free memory. So essentially we will be slowly processing all of
memory and it will take 16 calls (32 seconds) for us to process a
system that is sitting completely idle. It is meant to pace us so we
don't spend a ton of time doing work that will be undone, not to
prevent us from burying a CPU which is what seems to be implied here.

Using HUGEPAGE_REPORTING_CAPACITY makes no sense here. I was using it
in the original definition because it was how many pages we could
scoop out at a time and then I was aiming for a 16th of that. Here you
are arbitrarily squaring HUGEPAGE_REPORTING_CAPACITY in terms of the
amount of work you will doo since you are using it as a multiple
instead of a divisor.

It would be better for you to spend time understanding how this patch
set works before you go about expanding it to do other things.
Mistakes like the budget one above kind of point out the fact that you
don't understand how this code was supposed to work and just kind of
shoehorned you page zeroing code onto it.

It would be better to look at trying to understand this code first
before you extend it to support your zeroing use case. So adding huge
pages first might make more sense than trying to zero and push the
order down. The fact is the page reporting extension should be minimal
for huge pages since they are just passed as a scatterlist so you
should only need to add a small bit to page_reporting.c to extend it
to support this use case.

It comes down to the fact that the changes you made have a significant
impact on how this is supposed to function. Reducing the scatterlist
to a size of one makes the whole point of doing batching kind of
pointless. Basically the code should be rewritten with the assumption
that if you find a page you report it.

The old code would batch things up because there is significant
overhead to be addressed when going to the hypervisor to report said
memory. Your code doesn't seem to really take anything like that into
account and instead is using an arbitrary budget value based on the
page size.

Lastly I would recommend setting up and testing page reporting with
the virtio-balloon driver. I worry that your patch set would have a
significant negative impact on the performance of it. As I mentioned
before it was designed to be more of a leaky bucket solution to
reporting memory and was supposed to take about 30 seconds for it to
flush all of the memory in a guest. Your changes seem to be trying to
do a much more aggressive task and I worry that what you are going to
find is that it will easily push CPUs to 100% on an active system
since it will be aggressively trying to zero memory as soon as it is
freed rather than taking it at a slower pace.
