Ok, that's what I thought. There is one corner case that I've struggled
with though: Suppose the host has an SMBus-only driver, and the
proposed driver exposes this as an I2C device to the guest, which
makes it available to guest user space (or a guest kernel driver)
using the emulated smbus command set. Is it always possible for
the host user space to turn the I2C transaction back into the
expected SMBus transaction on the host?

This is certainly possible, but is independent of the implementation of
the guest driver. It's up to the host to provision the devices that
are actually passed down to the guest, and this could in theory
be any combination of emulated devices with devices connected to
any of the host's physical buses. The host may also decide to remap
the addresses of the devices during passthrough.
