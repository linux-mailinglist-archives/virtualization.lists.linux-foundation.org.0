What are you asking? Whether any drivers that set PCI_IRQ_AFFINITY also
set IRQF_NO_AUTOEN? I could not find any other drivers doing that, no.
When I said "isn't unique" I rather meant that other drivers need
something like this, and they likely do it in a driver specific, complex
fashion.

just poking around at random I found
drivers/scsi/mpi3mr/mpi3mr_fw.c

which does this last thing during initialization:

void mpi3mr_ioc_enable_intr(struct mpi3mr_ioc *mrioc)
{
        mrioc->intr_enabled = 1;
}

and the interrupt handler does:

static irqreturn_t mpi3mr_isr_primary(int irq, void *privdata)
{
        struct mpi3mr_intr_info *intr_info = privdata;
        struct mpi3mr_ioc *mrioc;
        u16 midx;
        u32 num_admin_replies = 0, num_op_reply = 0;

        if (!intr_info)
                return IRQ_NONE;

        mrioc = intr_info->mrioc;

        if (!mrioc->intr_enabled)
                return IRQ_NONE;


which seems to be trying to accomplish exactly the same thing and might
or might not actually need WRITE_ONCE or some barriers if it were to be
made 100% foolproof.

Exactly.  So here's what we are trying to do: driver is initializing
both itself and the device. As part of that, it assigns some IRQs. Once that
happens, device can trigger the IRQ callback by sending the interrupt.
If this happens too soon driver is not yet fully initialized and might
access uninitialized memory (and generally get confused because the
state is inconsistent).

Getting the IRQ in a disabled state and only enabling when we are
ready sounds like a very reasonable way to go about it just from
API perspective.

For virtio affinity is mostly an optimization, I don't think this
affects correctness.
