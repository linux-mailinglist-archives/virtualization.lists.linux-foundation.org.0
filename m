I think it's entirely reasonable to assume that any direct mappings 
specified for a device are valid for that device and its IOMMU. However, 
in the particular case of virtio, it really shouldn't ever have direct 
mappings anyway, since even if the underlying hardware did have any, the 
host can enforce the actual direct-mapping aspect itself, and just 
present them as unusable regions to the guest.

Again, that's irrelevant. It can only be about whether the actual 
->map_pages call succeeds or not. A driver could well know up-front that 
all instances support the same pgsize_bitmap and aperture, and set both 
at ->domain_alloc time, yet still be unable to handle an actual mapping 
without knowing which instance(s) that needs to interact with (e.g. 
omap-iommu).

Thanks,
Robin.
