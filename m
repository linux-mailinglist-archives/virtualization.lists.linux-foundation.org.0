Can we create multiple threads (a thread pool) on DPU and let these
threads process requests in parallel (While there is only one virt
queue).

So this is what we had done in virtiofsd. One thread is dedicated to
pull the requests from virt queue and then pass the request to thread
pool to process it. And that seems to help with performance in
certain cases.

Is that possible on DPU? That itself can give a nice performance
boost for certain workloads without having to implement multiqueue
actually.

Just curious. I am not opposed to the idea of multiqueue. I am
just curious about the kind of performance gain (if any) it can
provide. And will this be helpful for rust virtiofsd running on
host as well?

Thanks
Vivek
