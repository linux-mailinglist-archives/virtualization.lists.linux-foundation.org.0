For "virtio" do you mean it's an action that is defined in the spec?

Yes, one of the major motivations is to try to reuse the existing APIs
as much as possible as a start. It doesn't mean we can't invent new
API, but having a dedicated save/restore uAPI looks fine. But it looks
more like a work that needs to be finalized in the virtio spec
otherwise we may end up with code that is hard to maintain.
