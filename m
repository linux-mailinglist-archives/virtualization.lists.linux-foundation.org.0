I will make this new field depending on the dgram socket type.

For the union idea, could I change the order of those fields? Dgram does not use
flags and fwd_cnt fields, and I want to put them together with a union
of a le64 timestamp.
Something like:

struct virtio_vsock_hdr {
  le64 src_cid;
  le64 dst_cid;
  le32 src_port;
  le32 dst_port;
  le32 len;
  le16 type;
  le16 op;
  le32 buf_alloc;
 union {
        struct {
              le32 flags;
              le32 fwd_cnt;
        } stream;
        le64 dgram_timestamp;
     } internal; // or a better name
};

dgram_tx_bytes is a field in struct vhost_vsock and virtio_vsock. But
I don't see them
mentioned in the spec.

Sure.

In the  Linux and KVM case, I added the dgram_tx_bytes to vhost_vsock
and virtio_vsock.
Then in virtio_transport_send_pkt() and vhost_transport_send_pkt(),
the code will increase and check
dgram_tx_bytes first. If dgram_tx_bytes is no less than
VIRTIO_VSOCK_MAX_DGRAM_BUF_SIZE,
the function will free the pkt with virtio_transport_free_pkt() and
then return. The dgram_tx_bytes
is decreased in vhost_transport_do_send_pkt, just before each
virtio_transport_free_pkt() is called.
It is similar for the device case.

The goal is to limit the memory usage for the vsock. Since dgram does
not use credit, the sender
can send far more packets than the receiver can handle. If we don't
add the above check, the
sender can use lots of memory and cause OOM in the Linux kernel.

I am not sure if these details are too much for a spec or not. But I
think it will be good to
add some description. Or we can just say that the sender ( device or
the driver ) must not use
unlimited resources.

The sender will drop the packets. This one is independent of the rx
side. If the device is the
sender, device will drop the packets. If the driver is the sender, the
driver will drop the packets.

This is on the sender side (regardless of the driver or the device ).
This  is similar to
above mentioned dgram_tx_bytes. Dgram_tx_bytes only makes sure if the memory
usage reaches a limit, the sender will not consume more memory. But
dgram_tx_bytes
is shared among different dgram sockets for a device or the driver, a
misbehave or
malicious dgram socket can potentially use all memory and block other
dgram sockets.
from sending any new packets. To handle this case,
the tx_timeout is used to free some space from the sender's memory pool, so that
other dgram sockets can continue to send some packets.

dgram_tx_byte is for the tx (sender) side. The receive buffer you mentioned
is on the receiving side.

I am thinking about using jiffy in the Linux kernel. But for a more
generic virtio spec, maybe
we should use something more generic for the people not familiar with
Linux kernel?

Right, the driver should always set the source port correctly. Will fix it.

Yes.

Thanks for all the comments. I will fix those spelling errors and use
a spell check
next time. I hope I answered all your questions. Please let me know if I missed
any questions or anything still not clear.
