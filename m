Cool, thanks for checking!

I think optional is fine, and we should support it for all kind of 
traffic (stream, dgram, seqpacket).

Why not 4 KB like for stream? Or we could make it configurable.

Yes, sort of. Being a stream, there's no concept of a boundary.

Yep.

This is very similar to what we discussed with Michael. He pointed out 
that it could be complicated and we could have several problems.

For example, we should also provide an ID to prevent different fragments 
from overlapping. Also we might have problems handling different flows 
at the same time.

Mergable buffers allow us to avoid these problems and also bring 
advantages for the other types of traffic (stream, seqpacket).

It also allows us to use a single header for the packet and all its 
fragments.

So IMHO, if there are no significant issues, the best way would be to 
implement mergeable buffers in vsock,
I think there are only advantages to using this feature.

Thanks,
Stefano
