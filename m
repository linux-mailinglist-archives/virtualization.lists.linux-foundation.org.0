I didn't realize this mechanism (working around from user space) before
sending this patch set.

After learning the virtualization and KVM stuffs, I find that, as Vivek
Goyal replied in [1], virtiofsd/qemu need to somehow hook the user page
fault and then download the remained part.

IMHO, this mechanism (as you proposed by implementing a plain fuse
filesystem on the host) seems a little bit sophisticated so far.
