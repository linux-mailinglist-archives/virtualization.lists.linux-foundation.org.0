Thanks for your comments. If I understand correctly, we have two
options:
1. Use copy/fill_silence callbacks and use my own buffers thus disabling
mmap.
2. Use mmap and the ack callback to track when appl_ptr changes thus
moving the content to the queues after it has been updated.

Am I right? 

Thanks, Matias.
