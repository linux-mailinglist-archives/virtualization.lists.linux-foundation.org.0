The suggested timeout is not meant to take into account the overhead of
virtualization, but to be used by the virtio device as a timeout for the
transaction on the I2C bus (presumably by programming this value to the
physical I2C controller, if one exists).

Assume that userspace (or an I2C client driver) asks for a timeout of 20
ms for a particular transfer because it, say, knows that the particular
connected I2C peripheral either responds within 10 ms to a particular
register read or never responds, so it doesn't want to waste time
waiting unnecessarily long for the transfer to complete.

If the virtio device end does not have any information on what timeout
is required (as in the current spec), it must assume some high value
which will never cause I2C transactions to spuriously timeout, say 10
seconds.  

Even if the virtio driver is fixed to copy and hold all buffers to avoid
memory corruption and to time out and return to the caller after the
requested 20 ms, the next I2C transfer can not be issued until 10
seconds have passed, since the virtio device end will still be waiting
for the hardcoded 10 second timeout and may not respond to new requests
until that transfer has timed out.
