Yeah, that was sketched out on top of some other development patches, 
and in being so focused on not breaking any of the x86 behaviours I did 
indeed overlook fully converting the SMMU drivers... oops!

(my thought was to do the conversion for its own sake, then clean up the 
redundant attribute separately, but I guess it's fine either way)

I still have reservations about removing the attribute API entirely and 
pretending that io_pgtable_cfg is anything other than a SoC-specific 
private interface, but the reworked patch on its own looks reasonable to 
me, thanks! (I wasn't too convinced about the iommu_cmd_line wrappers 
either...) Just iommu_get_dma_strict() needs an export since the SMMU 
drivers can be modular - I consciously didn't add that myself since I 
was mistakenly thinking only iommu-dma would call it.

Robin.
