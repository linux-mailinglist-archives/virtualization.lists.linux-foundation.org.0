This thing apparently:

+               opcode = (pos < VIRTIO_PCI_CONFIG_OFF(true)) ?
+                       VIRTIO_ADMIN_CMD_LEGACY_COMMON_CFG_READ :
+                       VIRTIO_ADMIN_CMD_LEGACY_DEV_CFG_READ;

That "true" is supposed to be whether guest enabled MSI or not.

This mediation is kind of smallish, I agree. Not completely devoid of
logic though.

it will require maintainance effort when virtio changes are made.  For
example it pokes at the device state - I don't see specific races right
now but in the past we did e.g. reset the device to recover from errors
and we might start doing it again.

If more of the logic is under virtio directory where we'll remember
to keep it in loop, and will be able to reuse it from vdpa
down the road, I would be more sympathetic.
