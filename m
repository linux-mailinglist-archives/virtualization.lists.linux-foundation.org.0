FWIW, I'd say something like:

"The device and domain are incompatible. If this is due to some previous 
configuration of the domain, drivers should not log an error, since it 
is legitimate for callers to test reuse of an existing domain. 
Otherwise, it may still represent some fundamental problem."

And then at the public interfaces state it from other angle:

"The device and domain are incompatible. If the domain has already been 
used or configured in some way, attaching the same device to a different 
domain may be expected to succeed. Otherwise, it may still represent 
some fundamental problem."

[ and to save another mail, I'm not sure copying the default comment for 
ENOSPC is all that helpful either - what is "space" for something that 
isn't a storage device? I'd guess limited hardware resources in some 
form, but in the IOMMU context, potential confusion with address space 
is maybe a little too close for comfort? ]

Yeah, I don't think we need to go too mad here. Drivers shouldn't emit 
their *own* -EINVAL unless appropriate, but if it comes back from some 
external API then that implies something's gone unexpectedly wrong 
anyway - maybe it's a transient condition and a subsequent different 
attach might actually work out OK? We can't really say in general. 
Besides, if the driver sees an error which implies it's done something 
wrong itself, it probably shouldn't be trusted to try to reason about it 
further. The caller can handle any error as long as we set their 
expectations correctly.

Thanks,
Robin.
