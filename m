OK. The background of this work:
As well known, the memory failure mechanism handles memory corrupted 
event, and try to send SIGBUS to the user process which uses this 
corrupted page.

For the virtualization case, QEMU catches SIGBUS and tries to inject MCE 
into the guest, and the guest handles memory failure again. Thus the 
guest gets the minimal effect from hardware memory corruption.

The further step I'm working on:
1, try to modify code to decrease poisoned pages in a single place 
(mm/memofy-failure.c: simplify num_poisoned_pages_dec in this series).

2, try to use page_handle_poison() to handle SetPageHWPoison() and 
num_poisoned_pages_inc() together. It would be best to call 
num_poisoned_pages_inc() in a single place too. I'm not sure if this is 
possible or not, please correct me if I misunderstand.

3, introduce memory failure notifier list in memory-failure.c: notify 
the corrupted PFN to someone who registers this list.
If I can complete [1] and [2] part, [3] will be quite easy(just call 
notifier list after increasing poisoned page).

4, introduce memory recover VQ for memory balloon device, and registers 
memory failure notifier list. During the guest kernel handles memory 
failure, balloon device gets notified by memory failure notifier list, 
and tells the host to recover the corrupted PFN(GPA) by the new VQ.

5, host side remaps the corrupted page(HVA), and tells the guest side to 
unpoison the PFN(GPA). Then the guest fixes the corrupted page(GPA) 
dynamically.

Because [4] and [5] are related to balloon device, also CC Michael, 
David and Jason.
