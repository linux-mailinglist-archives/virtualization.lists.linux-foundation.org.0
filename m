The main request I have is to clearly define the meaning of the
VHOST_SET_VRING_ENABLE ioctl. If you want to keep it as-is for now and
the vhost maintainers are happy with then, that's okay. It should just
be documented so that userspace and other vhost driver authors
understand what it's supposed to do.

A 1:1 vCPU/vq->CPU mapping isn't desirable in all cases.

The CPU affinity is a userspace policy decision. The host kernel should
provide a mechanism but not the policy. That way userspace can decide
which workers are shared by multiple vqs and on which physical CPUs they
should run.
