I'm thinking about another question, how did the cross-numa appear here, and
virtio desc queue also has the problem of cross-numa. So is it necessary for us
to deal with the cross-numa scene?

Indirect desc is used as virtio desc, so as long as it is in the same numa as
virito desc. So we can allocate indirect desc cache at the same time when
allocating virtio desc queue.

Of course, we need to solve the problem that rx does not need indirect desc
cache. So it is necessary to set whether to use indirect desc cache based on
pre-queue.
