I think that's the same scenario

But the main change in this patch is to turn some virtqueue_disable_cb
calls into no-ops. I don't understand how that helps reduce spurious
interrupts, as if anything, it keeps interrupts enabled for longer.

Another patch in the series disable callbacks* before starting to
clean the descriptors from the rx interrupt. That I do understand will
suppress additional tx interrupts that might see no work to be done. I
just don't entire follow this patch on its own.

*(I use interrupt and callback as a synonym in this context, correct
me if I'm glancing over something essential)
