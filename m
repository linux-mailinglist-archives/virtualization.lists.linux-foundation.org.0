Some folks have been doing it since the early 2010s.

But I think it really took off after the Change-Id discussion a few
years back:

  https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAHk-=whFbgy4RXG11c_=S7O-248oWmwB_aZOcWzWMVh3w7=RCw@mail.gmail.com/

Which I read as you endorsing Link: tags :)

For me it always makes sense, because it means I can easily go from a
commit back to the original submission. That's useful for automating
various things like replies and patchwork status updates.

It allows me to find the exact patch I applied, even if what I committed
is slightly different (due to fuzz or editing), which would be harder
with a search based approach.

It gives us a way to essentially augment the change log after the fact,
by replying to the original patch with things we didn't know at the time
of commit - eg. this patch was reverted because it caused a bug, etc.

If you follow the Link: and there's nothing useful there explaining
what motivated the change then that's a bug in the patch submission, not
the Link: tag.

Really important information should be in the change log itself, but the
space below the "---" is perfect for added context that would be too
verbose for the committed change log. And anyone can reply to the
original submission to add even more useful information.

cheers
