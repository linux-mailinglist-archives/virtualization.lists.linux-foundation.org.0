Hm, I don't see that in two examples, that I looked at: mtk and virtio. In both 
cases the announcement seems to be directly coming from the application processor 
maybe after some initialisation.

No, it's "vhost_..." so it's running on the host. The host (the server, an 
analogue of the application processor, IIUC) sends NS announcements to guests.

Yes, I've had a look at that series, thanks for forwarding it to me. TBH I 
don't quite understand some choices there, e.g. creating a separate driver and 
then having to register devices just for the namespace announcement. I don't 
think creating virtual devices is taken easily in Linux. But either way I 
don't think our series conflict a lot, but I do hope that I can merge my 
series first, he'd just have to switch to using the header, that I'm adding. 
Hardly too many changes otherwise.

I've improved that description a bit, it was indeed rather clumsy.

I can add some kerneldoc documentation there, no problem.

Thanks for your reviews! I'd very much like to close all the still open points 
and merge the series ASAP.
