IMHO both ways options to disable the KMS bits should work the same way.
With the current patch modeset_init() runs with num_scanouts == 0 but
doesn't with CONFIG_KMS=n.  There are also two different ways to tweak
driver_features.  Can we get rid of that please, for robustness reasons?

I'd suggest to have a is_kms_enabled() helper function (probably best as
inline so gcc can figure it is constant false for CONFIG_KMS=n and throw
away unreachable code).  Add "if (!is_kms_enabled()) return;" to
modeset_init() and modeset_fini() instead of stubbing them out.  Use the
drm_device->driver_features override in both cases.

Also the edid check can go away.  As already mentioned this is about a
device feature not a edid being present.

take care,
  Gerd
