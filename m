Any unprivileged user can check into this field to know parent device's capability without having to create a child vDPA device at all. The features that child vDPA device may support should be a subset of, or at most up to what the parent device offers. For e.g. the vdpa device dev1 you created below can expose less or equal device_features bit than 0x308820028 (MTU MAC CTRL_VQ CTRL_MAC_ADDR ANY_LAYOUT VERSION_1 ACCESS_PLATFORM), but shouldn't be no more than what the parent device can actually support.

I think VDPA_ATTR_VDPA_DEV_SUPPORTED_FEATURES and
VDPA_ATTR_DEV_FEATURES are equivalent, we can rebase on each other if
it is needed.

For e.g. for cpu flags, mgmt software can infer the guest cpus features in use from all qemu command line arguments and host cpu features/capability, which doesn't need to remember creation arguments and is easy to recover from failure without having to make the VM config persistent in data store. I thought it would be great if vdpa CLI design could offer the same.
