I think it's a hack for two reasons:

  (1) We're changing userspace to avoid a breaking change in kernel behaviour
  (2) I think that crosvm's approach is actually pretty reasonable

To elaborate on (2), crosvm has a set of device features that it has
negotiated with the guest. It then takes the intersection of these features
with those advertised by VHOST_GET_FEATURES and calls VHOST_SET_FEATURES
with the result. If there was a common interpretation of what these features
do, then this would work and would mean we wouldn't have to opt-in on a
per-flag basis for vhost. Since VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM is being overloaded
to mean two completely different things, then it breaks and I think masking
out that specific flag is a hack because it's basically crosvm saying "yeah,
I may have negotiated this with the driver but vhost _actually_ means
'IOTLB' when it says it supports this flag so I'll mask it out because I
know better".

As above, the issue is that vhost now unconditionally advertises this in
VHOST_GET_FEATURES and so a VMM with no knowledge of IOTLB can end up
enabling it by accident.
