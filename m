Enrico it's great that you are reaching out to the
wider storage community before making spec changes.

Christoph could you please comment on whether this addresses
your concerns with the lifetime feature.
You wrote "it really needs to stand a lone and be properly documented"
and this seems to be the direction this patch is going in.

These links really belong in either normative or non-normative
references section.

All this seems kind of vague. What does one need that spec for?
Is it just a note for pass-through developers?

How about "to simplify pass-through
from eMMC devices the format of fields 
  pre_eol_info, device_lifetime_est_typ_a and device_lifetime_est_typ_b
matches PRE_EOL_INFO, DEVICE_LIFETIME_EST_TYP_A and DEVICE_LIFETIME_EST_TYP_B
in the 
\hyperref[intro:PCI]{[PCI]}.



Also, now that I mention it, what about NVMe pass-through? Arguably
nvme is getting more popular. Will we be able to support that use-case
as well? Or is more data needed? What is the plan there?

Block comments /* */ should be used as these are documented
