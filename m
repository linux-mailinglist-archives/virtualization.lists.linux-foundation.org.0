I've evidently done a bad job of explaining this, sorry.

crosvm _does_ filter the feature bits which it passes to vhost. It takes the
feature set which it has negotiated with the guest and then takes the
intersection of this set with the set of features which vhost advertises.
The result is what is passed to VHOST_SET_FEATURES. I included the rust
for this in my initial mail, but in C it might look something like:

	u64 features = negotiate_features_with_guest(dev);

	ioctl(vhost_fd, VHOST_GET_FEATURES, &vhost_features);
	vhost_features &= features;	/* Mask out unsupported features */
	ioctl(vhost_fd, VHOST_SET_FEATURES, &vhost_features);

The problem is that crosvm has negotiated VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM with
the guest so that restricted DMA is used for the virtio devices. With
e13a6915a03f, VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM is now advertised by
VHOST_GET_FEATURES and so IOTLB is enabled by the sequence above.

I agree that changing crosvm to use an allowlist would fix the problem,
I'm just questioning whether we should be changing userspace at all to
resolve this issue.

I think crosvm is trying to cater for this by masking out the features
it doesn't know about.
