But it's not "blindly", right? I've sent this review mail over a week
ago, and if it goes into the queue there will be at least two more
emails going out to the author/maintainers.

During all this time it gets tested by various entities who do things
that go beyond simple boot testing.

I'd argue that the backports we push in the stable tree sometimes get
tested and reviewed better than the commits that land upstream.
