We do actually test every -rc with Android (and run a whole bunch of
regression tests), this is largely using x86 builds for convenience
but we've been bringing up arm64 recently and are getting increasingly
more coverage there. So this _will_ improve and relatively soon.

The kicker in this case is that we'd only catch it on systems using pKVM
(arm64 host only; upstreaming ongoing) with restricted DMA (requires
device-tree) and so it slipped through. This is made more challenging
for CI because arm64 devices don't tend to have support for nested
virtualisation and so we have to run bare-metal but, as I say, we're
getting there.

It was already renamed once (!) It used to be VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM...

Something along those lines makes sense to me, but it's fiddly because
the bits being used here are part of the virtio spec and we can't freely
allocate them in Linux. I reckon it would probably be better to have a
separate mechanism to enable IOTLB and not repurpose this flag for it.
Hindsight is a wonderful thing.

No argument here, and it's a big part of the reason I made the effort to
write this up. Yes, we hit this in Android. Yes, we should've hit it
sooner.  But is it specific to Android? No. Anybody wanting a guest to
use the DMA API for its virtio devices is going to be setting this flag
and if they implement the same algorithm as crosvm then they're going to
hit exactly the same problem that we did.
