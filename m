Looks like out of tree modules get a free pass then.
Which is exactly the reverse of what it should be,
people who spent the time to get their drivers into the kernel
expect that if kernel decides to change some API their
driver is automatically updated. This was always the social
contract, was it not?

IIUC userspace is the distro. It can also do more than a binary on/off,
e.g. it can decide "only virtio", "no out of tree drivers".
A distro can also ship configs with a specific features
enabled/disabled. E.g. I can see where some GPU drivers will be
included by some distros since they are so useful, and excluded
by others since they are so big and hard to audit.
I don't see how the kernel can reasonably make a stand here.
Is "some audit and some fuzzing" a good policy? How much is enough?

Well if userspace sets the policy then I'm not sure we also want
a kernel one ... but if yes I'd like it to be in a central
place so whoever is building the kernel can tweak it easily
and rebuild, without poking at individual drivers.

If it's e.g. the kernel command line then we can set that
when building the kernel right? No need for a dedicated interface
just for this ...
