Okay, but we should allow to run an old QEMU (without DGRAM) with a new 
kernel (with DGRAM support built it) and viceversa.
The features bit are used to guarantee compatibility and to enable and 
disable features at runtime depending on what the device or driver 
supports.

Make sense to me. Maybe we can replase s/receive queue(s)/datagram rx 
queue/.
