BTW, which particular knob you are finding useful in control filesystem
for virtiofs. As you mentioned "abort" we will not implement. "waiting"
might not have much significance as well because requests are handed
over to virtiofs immidiately and if they can be sent to server (because
virtqueue is full) these are queued internally and fuse layer will not
have an idea.

That leaves us with "congestion_threshold" and "max_background".
max_background seems to control how many background requests can be
submitted at a time. That probably can be useful if server is overwhelemed
and we want to slow down the client a bit.

Not sure about congestion threshold.

So have you found some knob useful for your use case?

Thanks
Vivek
