Without knowing (or really caring) at all how virtqueue works, this
sounds very much like the classic pipe deadlock where two processes
communicate over a pair of pipes, sending each other commands, and
replying to each other with status updates.

And you absolutely cannot do that if one side can possibly want to up
fill the whole pipe.

Deadlock:

 - process A is trying to send data to process B (on 'pipe_A'), and
blocks because the pipe is full

 - process B is reads the data and everything is fine, and A gets to continue

 - but then process B sends some stratus update the other way (on
'pipe_B' - you can't use the same pipe for bidirectional, it's why you
use a pair of pipes or a socketpair) and waits for the result.

 - now A and B are both waiting for each other - A is waiting for B to
empty the big bunch of data it's sending, and B is waiting for the
result for the (small) command it sent.

and neither makes any progress.

You can find several mentions of these kinds of problems by just
googling for "bidirectional pipe deadlock" or similar.

The solution is invariably to either

 (a) make sure that nobody writes even remotely close to enough data
to fill a pipe before reading the other pipe (you can still fill up a
pipe, but at least somebody is always going to succeed and make
progress and do the read to make progress).

 (b) make sure everybody who writes to a pipe will use nonblocking IO
(and is willing to do reads in between to satisfy the other end).

That first case is basically what one of the PIPE_BUF guarantees is
all about (the other one is the atomicity it guarantees, ie you can
write a "command packet" and be guaranteed that readers will see it
without data mixed in from other writes).

I have no idea what your client/agent does and how it interacts with
the virtio pipes, but it really _sounds_ like a very similar issue,
where it used to work (because PIPE_BUF) and now no longer does
(because pipe filled).

And that virtio_console __send_control_msg() pattern very much sounds
like a "send data and wait for ACK" behavior of "process B".
