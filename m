Hmm I would worry that this disables the feature for old QEMU :(

Thanks!
I'm a bit concerned that the trick I proposed changes the configuration
where iotlb was not set up from "access to memory not allowed" to
"access to all memory allowed". This just might have security
implications if some application assumed the former.
And the one Stefano proposed disables IOTLB for old QEMU versions.

So for crosvm change, I will post the documentation change and
you guys can discuss?
