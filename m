Thanks for the analysis, however for small payloads it makes sense that
the cost might be too high that optimization does not bring benefits.

Makes sense!

Yeah, I like this split, but I'd include 14 in the (10, 13) group.

I have reviewed most of them and I think we are well on our way :-)
I've already seen that Bobby suggested changes for v5, so I'll review
that version better.

Great work so far!

Thanks,
Stefano
