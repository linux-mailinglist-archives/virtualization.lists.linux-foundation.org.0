tap_get_user performs basic bounds checking on the length passed.

A device cannot blindly trust a hdr_len passed from a driver. We have
had bugs in the kernel with this before, such as the one fixed in
commit 57031eb79490 ("packet: round up linear to header len").

I disagree. If it's not much effort to make a commit self-documenting
that is preferable. And if not, then an explicit reference to an
authoratitive external reference is preferable over "it is trivial to
look it up".
