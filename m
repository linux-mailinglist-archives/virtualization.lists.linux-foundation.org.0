That's not how stable releases work at all.

Patches for stable kernels need to go into Linus's tree first, and if
you have the MAINTAINERS file updated properly there, then you will be
properly cc:ed.  We do not look at the MAINTAINERS file for the older
kernel when sending patches out, it's totally ignored as that was the
snapshot at a point in time, which is usually no longer the true state.

So this would have no affect at all, sorry.  That's why I asked if you
all really realized what you were doing here :)

thanks,
