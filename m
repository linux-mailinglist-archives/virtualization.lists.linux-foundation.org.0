I assume this machinery is for the ARM GIC ITS page....

I think this is a different issue. The domain is supposed to represent
the actual io pte storage, and the storage is supposed to exist even
when the domain is not attached to anything.

As we said with tegra-gart, it is a bug in the driver if all the
mappings disappear when the last device is detached from the domain.
Driver bugs like this turn into significant issues with vfio/iommufd
as this will result in warn_on's and memory leaking.

So, I disagree that this is something we should be allowing in the API
design. map_pages should succeed (memory allocation failures aside) if
a IOVA within the aperture and valid flags are presented. Regardless
of the attachment status. Calling map_pages with an IOVA outside the
aperture should be a caller bug.

It looks omap is just mis-designed to store the pgd in the omap_iommu,
not the omap_iommu_domain :( pgd is clearly a per-domain object in our
API. And why does every instance need its own copy of the identical
pgd?
