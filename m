8-bit indexed with 256 entry palette.

Oh, that's good to know!
Does this mean fbdev is not deprecated for anything <= C8? ;-)

A while ago, I was looking into converting an fbdev driver to drm, and
one of the things I ran into is lack of C4, C2, C1, Y8, Y4, Y2, and
monochrome support.  On top of that, lots of internal code seems to
assume pixels are never smaller than a byte (thus ignoring
char_per_block[]/block_w).  The lack of support for planar modes isn't
that bad, combined with the need for copying, as c2p conversion can be
done while copying, thus even making life easier for userspace
applications that can just always work on chunky data.
Then real work kicked in, before I got anything working...

Thanks!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
