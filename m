I think we can prevent mixing because virtuqueue is point to point and 
its use is not thread safe, so the access (in the same peer) is already 
serialized.
In the end the packet would be fragmented only before copying it to the 
virtuqueue.

But maybe I missed something...

No, I hope not :-), in the end our advantage is that we have a channel 
that doesn't lose packets, so I guess we can make assumptions that the 
network stack can't.

Thanks,
Stefano
