Can you give me an example, even artificial, in which the linked-list

Can you explain your reasoning in considering the entry stack unsafe?
It's 4k bytes these days.

You forgot about entry_SYSCALL_compat.

Your 8-byte alignment is confusing to me.  In valid kernel code, SP
should be 8-byte-aligned already, and, if you're trying to match
architectural behavior, the CPU aligns to 16 bytes.

We're not robust against #VC, NMI in the #VC prologue before the magic
stack switch, and a new #VC in the NMI prologue.  Nor do we appear to
have any detection of the case where #VC nests directly inside its own
prologue.  Or did I miss something else here?

If we get NMI and get #VC in the NMI *asm*, the #VC magic stack switch
looks like it will merrily run itself in the NMI special-stack-layout
section, and that sounds really quite bad.

I mean that, IIRC, a malicious hypervisor can inject inappropriate
vectors at inappropriate times if the #HV mechanism isn't enabled.
For example, it could inject a page fault or an interrupt in a context
in which we have the wrong GSBASE loaded.

But the #DB issue makes this moot.  We have to use IST unless we turn
off SCE.  But I admit I'm leaning toward turning off SCE until we have
a solution that seems convincingly robust.
