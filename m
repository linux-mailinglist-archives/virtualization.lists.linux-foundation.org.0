Right, that's the gist of what I was getting at - I think it's worth 
putting in the effort to audit and fix the drivers so that that *can* be 
the case, then we can have a meaningful error API with standard codes 
effectively for free, rather than just sighing at the existing mess and 
building a slightly esoteric special case on top.

Case in point, the AMD checks quoted above are pointless, since it 
checks the same things in ->probe_device, and if that fails then the 
device won't get a group so there's no way for it to even reach 
->attach_dev any more. I'm sure there's a *lot* of cruft that can be 
cleared out now that per-device and per-domain ops give us this kind of 
inherent robustness.

Cheers,
Robin.
