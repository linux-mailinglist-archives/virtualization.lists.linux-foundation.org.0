Yes, much better.

Yes.

Yes, that's one part of it. Read below.

I probably should have added the following to the patch description:

"This is a preparation for Big Block Mode (BBM), whereby we can see some
temporary offlining of memory blocks without actually making progress"

Imagine you have a Big Block that spans to Linux memory blocks. Assume
the first Linux memory blocks has no unmovable data on it.

Assume you call offline_and_remove_memory()

1. Try to offline the first block. Works, notifiers triggered.
virtio_mem_retry().
2. Try to offline the second block. Does not work.
3. Re-online first block.
4. Exit to main loop, exit workqueue.
5. Retry immediately (due to virtio_mem_retry()), go to 1.

So, you'll keep retrying forever. Found while debugging that exact issue :)
