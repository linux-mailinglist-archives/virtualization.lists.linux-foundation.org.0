Call For Nominations: ACM HPDC Achievement Award 2022

In 2012, HPDC established an annual achievement award, which is
presented to an individual who has made long-lasting, influential
contributions to the foundations or practice of the field of
high-performance parallel and distributed computing (HPDC). These
contributions may include one or more of the following:
- conceptual advances that have influenced the design or operation of
HPDC systems or applications;
- innovative techniques or tools for the design or analysis of HPDC
systems or applications;
- the design, the implementation, and the deployment of innovative
(components of) HPDC systems or applications;
- the analysis of innovative (components of) HPDC systems or applications.

In selecting the achievement award recipient, the Award Selection
Committee will place particular emphasis on seminal contributions and
a sustained record of high-impact in the field.

Past Winners:
- 2021: Rosa Badia, for her innovations in parallel task-based
programming models, workflow applications and systems, and leadership
in the high performance computing research community.
- 2020: No winner
- 2019: Geoffrey Fox, for his foundational contributions to parallel
computing, high-performance software, the interface between
applications and systems, contributions to education, and outreach to
underrepresented communities.
- 2018: Satoshi Matsuoka, for his pioneering research in the design,
implementation, and application of high performance systems and
software tools for parallel and distributed systems.
- 2017: David Abramson, for his pioneering research in the design,
implementation, and application of high performance systems and
software tools for parallel and distributed systems.
- 2016: Jack Dongarra, for his long-standing and far-reaching
contributions in high performance linear algebra and large-scale
parallel and distributed computing.
- 2015: Ewa Deelman, for her significant influence, contributions, and
distinguished use of workflow systems in high-performance computing.
- 2014: Rich Wolski, for pioneering and high-impact contributions to
grid, cloud, and parallel computing.
- 2013: Miron Livny, for his significant contribution and high impact
in the area of high-throughput computing.
- 2012: Ian Foster, for his initiative in the creation and development
of grid computing and his significant contributions to
high-performance distributed computing in support of the sciences.

Achievement Award Talk:
The award will be presented at the 31st International Symposium on
High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, United States, June 27 - July 1, 2022. The winner should be
available to receive the award and present an achievement award talk
at the conference.

Nominations for the 2022 Award:
Candidates may nominate a colleague by sending a letter in PDF form to
dthain@nd.edu. Each nomination received will be retained and
considered by the committee for three consecutive years. The letter of
nomination should be about one page and contain:
1. The nominee's current professional affiliation(s).
2. A brief citation (thirty words or less) precisely stating the most
salient reason(s) why the nominee is qualified for the award.
3. A description of the technical contributions of the nominee and
their significance and impact.

Important Dates:
Nomination deadline: Wednesday, March 31th, 2022

2022 Award Selection Committee:
- Rosa Badia
- Jon Weissman
- Abhishek Chandra
- Ada Gavrilovska
