I don't see how what this patchset is doing is different
wrt to Confidential compute - you trap IO accesses and emulate.
Care to elaborate?

This has nothing to do with data formats - you need two devices to
behave identically. Which is what VDPA is about really.

There's no "the solution" - this sounds like a vendor only caring about
solutions that involve that vendor's hardware exclusively, a little.

VDPA basically should be a kind of "VFIO for virtio".
