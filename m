Right, so I'd update the test to behave like this.
And I'd explain better the problem we are going to fix in the commit 
message.

We did it to avoid a lot of credit update messages.
Anyway I think here the main point is why RX is setting SO_RCVLOWAT to 
128 KB and then reads only half of it?

So I think if the users set SO_RCVLOWAT to a value and then RX reads 
less then it, is expected to get stuck.

Anyway, since the change will not impact the default behaviour 
(SO_RCVLOWAT = 1) we can merge this patch, but IMHO we need to explain 
the case better and improve the test.

RX will wake up because SO_RCVLOWAT is 64KB and there are 64 KB in the 
buffer. Then RX will read it and send the credit update to TX because
free_space is 0.

Thanks,
Stefano
