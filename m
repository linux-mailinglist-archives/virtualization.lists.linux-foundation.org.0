We understand that and try to minimize the impact by using an already
existing unused field of skb.

When this set of patches is related to hash delivery in the virtio-net
packet in general,
it was prepared in context of RSS feature implementation as defined in
virtio spec [1]
In case of RSS it is not enough to run the flow_dissector in tun_put_user:
in tun_ebpf_select_queue the TUN calls eBPF to calculate the hash,
hash type and queue index
according to the (mapped) parameters (key, hash types, indirection
table) received from the guest.
Our intention is to keep the hash and hash type in the skb to populate them
into a virtio-net header later in tun_put_user.
Note that in this case the type of calculated hash is selected not
only from flow dissections
but also from limitations provided by the guest.
This is already implemented in qemu (for case of vhost=off), see [2]
(virtio_net_process_rss)
For case of vhost=on there are WIP for qemu to load eBPF and attach it to TUN.

Note that exact way of selecting rx virtqueue depends on the guest,
it could be automatic steering (typical for Linux VM), RSS (typical
for Windows VM) or
any other steering mechanism implemented in loadable TUN steering BPF with
or without hash calculation.

Unfortunately in the case of RSS we can't get this hash from the hardware as
this requires configuration of the NIC's hardware with key and hash types for
Toeplitz hash calculation.

The hash is used in combination with the indirection table to select
destination rx virtqueue.
The hash and hash type are to be reported in virtio-net header, if requested.
For Windows VM - in case the device does not report the hash (even if
it calculated it to
schedule the packet to a proper queue), the driver must do that for each packet
(this is a certification requirement).
