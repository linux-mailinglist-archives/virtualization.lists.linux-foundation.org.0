I thought about this too.  dgram can have a separate rx/tx
path from stream types. In this case, the the_virtio_vsock
will still be shared because the virtqueues have to be in one
structure. Then the_virtio_vsock will be protected by a rcu
and a reference counting ( or a sleepable RCU ).

In vhost_vsock_dev_release, it will wait for both rcu and another
one to be finished and then free the memory. I think this is
doable. Let me know if there is a better way to do it.
Btw, I think dgram tx code path will be quite different from
stream, but dgram rx path will be similar to stream type.

I am not sure about the last sentence. In the new design, there will
be no other queued packets for dgram (except those in the virtqueue).
When dgram tx virtqueue is freed by the device, the driver side
just needs to free some space. No need
to trigger more transmission.

Got it. Thanks. I will send a v2 spec soon.
