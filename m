Christoph,

I've been wrestling with the same thing - this is specific to busted
drivers. And in reality you could do the same thing with a hardware
virtio device (see example in http://thunderclap.io/) - where the
mitigation is 'enable the IOMMU to do its job.'.

AMD SEV documents speak about utilizing IOMMU to do this (AMD SEV-SNP)..
and while that is great in the future, SEV without IOMMU is now here.

Doing a full circle here, this issue can be exploited with virtio
but you could say do that with real hardware too if you hacked the
firmware, so if you say used Intel SR-IOV NIC that was compromised
on an AMD SEV machine, and plumbed in the guest - the IOMMU inside
of the guest would be SWIOTLB code. Last line of defense against
bad firmware to say.

As such I am leaning towards taking this code, but I am worried
about the performance hit .. but perhaps I shouldn't as if you
are using SWIOTLB=force already you are kind of taking a
performance hit?
