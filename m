Hmm I don't know offhand which duplication this refers to specifically
so maybe it's not worth addressing specifically but generally not
cleaning up code just because of backports seems wrong ...

Yes, it's a UAPI extension, not to be done lightly. In this case IIUC
gso_type in the header is only u8 - 8 bits and 5 of these are already
used.  So I don't think the virtio TC will be all that happy to burn up
a bit unless a clear benefit can be demonstrated. 

I agree with the net-next proposal, I think it's more a feature than a
bugfix. In particular I think a Fixes tag can also be dropped in that
IIUC GSO for vlan packets didn't work even before that commit - right?
