Got it. I was thinking only for dgram originally, but I think it should be fine
for stream and seqpacket too.

Btw, I have a small implementation question. For now, the vsock
allocates rx buffers with two scatterlist. One for header and one for the
payload. After we enable VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF feature,
do we still want to allocate buffers like that? Or could we just use
one big scatterlist for the whole packet? I think using the same allocation
method is fine, but it just may not line up with the real packets well since
we will skip headers for the big packets except the first buffer.

OK. sure. 4 KB is fine with me. I mentioned 16 KB because I was thinking
jumbo frames in the ethernet world. But  I just found out the jumbo frame
is about 8 KB or 9 KB only.

If we make it configurable, what kind of interface to use to configure it?
In linux, we could use something like the sysfs interface. I guess we don't
need to specify that detail in the spec though. I will just put the size should
be configurable in the spec.

Sure. Got it. I was thinking only about dgram, which is simpler than
stream and seqpacket. For those two, they will have issues as you
just mentioned.

Also, just to make sure. For steam and seqpacket, supporting
mergeable buffers is mainly for performance improvements,
right? Or to save memory? I think functionally, they will be the
same with or without
mergeable buffers. For dgram, the maximum supported packet size
is increased when using MRG_RXBUF if the rx buf size is fixed,
and it can save lots of memory.

I am a little bit confused about the motivation to support mergeable
buffers for stream and seqpacket. Could you remind me again? Sorry
that if it was already mentioned in the old emails.

We could only support it on dgram since dgram has its own virtqueues.

btw, my company email system automatically adds [External] to
these emails, and I meant to remove it manually when I reply,
but forgot to do that sometimes, so the email threading may not
be very accurate.
Sorry about that.
