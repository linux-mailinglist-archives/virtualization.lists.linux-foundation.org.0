This will change in the next version, in it I'll remove response preparation from 
request handling.

My RPMsg implementation supports two modes for sending data from the host (in 
VM terms) to guests: as responses to their requests and as asynchronous 
messages. If there isn't a strict request-response pattern on a certain endpont, 
you leave the .write callback NULL and then you send your messages as you please 
independent of requests. But you can also specify a .write pointer in which case 
after each request to generate a response.

In principle this response handling could be removed, but then drivers, that do 
need to respond to requests would have to schedule an asynchronous action in 
their .read callbacks to be triggered after request processing has completed.

Thanks
Guennadi
