Me as in which component?
And I don't really understand how this answers the question.
If hardware only supports 5 vectors, how can we expose 16
vectors to guest? Host can send to guest as many as it wants,
sure (this is the callback you are referring to, right?)
but host will not know which interrupt to send.
I conclude that exposing to guest more vectors than
hardware supports is simply not something we should do.
