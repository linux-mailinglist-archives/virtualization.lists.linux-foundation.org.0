I see thanks for the pointer.

Maybe somewhere in memory-barriers.txt.

Right.

Yes, actually the pairing is done by the device where it need something like:

if (get_status(DRIVER_OK)) {
    rmb();
    start_device_logic();
    raise_interrupt();
}

Yes, for a well behaved device, the device will raise the interrupt
after it sees DRIVER_OK and the ssch guarantees that when the device
sees DRIVER_OK vq->broken is false.

Exactly.

Looks like it's not a serialization instruction and this
memory-barriers.rst told me irq-disabling is only a compiler barrier:

"""
Functions that disable interrupts (ACQUIRE equivalent) and enable interrupts
(RELEASE equivalent) will act as compiler barriers only.  So if memory or I/O
barriers are required in such a situation, they must be provided from some
other means.
"""
