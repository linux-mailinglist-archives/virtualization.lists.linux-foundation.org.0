I think that right now the right thing to do is to validate untrusted
input and fail invalid operations.
The spec does say "VIRTIO_NET_F_MQ Requires VIRTIO_NET_F_CTRL_VQ".
If there are existing legacy drivers
violating some rules, then we should consider working around that (and
maybe documenting that in the spec in the legacy section).
