Currently we use 4-byte alignmed (FILE_LONG_ALIGNMENT)  in both Windows
virtio blk and scsi miniport drivers.
It shouldn't be a problem to change it to 512 by setting AlignmentMask
field of PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION structure
(
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/ns-=
storport-_port_configuration_information
)
to FILE_512_BYTE_ALIGNMENT.
I don't see any problem with changing the alignment parameter in our
drivers. But it will take us some time to test it properly.

Best regards,
Vadim.
