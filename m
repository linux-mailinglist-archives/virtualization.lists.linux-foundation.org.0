The actual problem is that a FIFO will cause openat() to block until
the other end of the FIFO is open for writing...

... and cause a DoS on virtiofsd. So yes, this is a security issue and
lo_inode_open() was introduced specifically to handle this.

"race-free way" means a way that guarantees that file type
cannot change between the time you check it and the time
you open it (TOCTOU error). For example, doing a plain stat(),
checking st_mode and proceeding to open() is wrong : nothing
prevents the file to be unlinked and replaced by something
else between stat() and open().

We avoid that by keeping O_PATH fds around and using
lo_inode_open() instead of openat().

In your case, it seems that you should do the checking after
you have an actual lo_inode for the target file, and pass
that to lo_should_enable_dax() instead of the parent lo_inode
and target name.

Cheers,
