Initially I thought that they needed it because they are downloading
files on the fly from server. So they don't want to enable dax on the file
till file is completely downloaded. But later I realized that they should
be able to block in FUSE_SETUPMAPPING call and make sure associated
file section has been downloaded before returning and solve the problem.
So that can't be the primary reason.

Other reason mentioned I think was that only certain files benefit
from DAX. But not much details are there after that. It will be nice
to hear a more concrete use case and more details about this usage.

Thanks
Vivek
