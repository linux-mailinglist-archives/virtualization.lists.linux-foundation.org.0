It has been already done for a few USB/TB drivers, but yes not for the 
majority of the kernel.

The goal is to do similar work as USB/TB did, but do it for a small set 
of virtio drivers and use a custom allow list for those for the specific 
secure guest cases.

(there are some other goals, but let's not discuss them here for now)

It's similar techniques as we do on user space accesses. For example if 
you bound check some value the code needs to ensure it is cached in 
private memory, not reread from MMIO or shared memory. Of course that's 
a good idea anyways for performance because MMIO is slow.

In the concrete cases of virtio the main problem was the free list in 
shared memory, but that has been addressed now.

For TDX it's currently only virtio net/block/console

But we expect this list to grow slightly over time, but not at a high 
rate (so hopefully <10)

Well, I mean we already have a similar situation with user space APIs. 
So it's not a new problem. For those we've done it for many years, with 
audits and extra fuzzing.

There are people working on the audit and fuzzing today. How exactly it 
will be ensured long term is still be worked out, but I expect we can 
work out something.

Agreed. The thread ended up about a lot of stuff which is outside the 
scope of the patches.

Yes that's the intention. This patch kit is only about controlling what 
devices can enumerate.

Also please let's avoid the "trusted" term. It's really misleading and 
confusing in the context of confidential computing.
