Those UUIDs are supplied by existing hypervisor code; in that regard,
this is almost like a driver for a hardware device. It is written
against a fixed API provided by the underlying machine. Making sure
that the sequence of UUIDs, as seen from inside the machine, never
changes back to a previous one is the responsibility of the hypervisor
and out of scope for this driver.

Microsoft's spec document (which is a .docx file for reasons I don't
understand) actually promises us that it is a cryptographically random
128-bit integer value, which means that if you fork a VM 2^64 times,
the probability that any two of those VMs have the same counter is
2^-64. That should be good enough.

But in userspace, we just need a simple counter. There's no need for
us to worry about anything else, like timestamps or whatever. If we
repeatedly fork a paused VM, the forked VMs will see the same counter
value, but that's totally fine, because the only thing that matters to
userspace is that the counter changes when the VM is forked.

And actually, since the value is a cryptographically random 128-bit
value, I think that we should definitely use it to help reseed the
kernel's RNG, and keep it secret from userspace. That way, even if the
VM image is public, we can ensure that going forward, the kernel RNG
will return securely random data.
