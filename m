This approach is more restrictive than required by the VIRTIO
specification:

  "The device SHOULD accept any valid subset of features the driver
  accepts, otherwise it MUST fail to set the FEATURES_OK device status
  bit when the driver writes it."

  https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.1/cs01/virtio-v1.1-cs01.html=
#x1-130002

The spec allows a device to reject certain subsets of features. For
example, if feature B depends on feature A and can only be enabled when
feature A is also enabled.

=46rom your description I think VDUSE would accept feature B without
feature A since the device implementation has no opportunity to fail
negotiation with custom logic.

Ideally VDUSE would send a SET_FEATURES message to userspace, allowing
the device implementation full flexibility in which subsets of features
to accept.

This is a corner case. Many or maybe even all existing VIRTIO devices
don't need this flexibility, but I want to point out this limitation in
the VDUSE interface because it may cause issues in the future.

The spec uses MUST and other terms to define the precise requirements.
Here the language (especially the word "generally") is weaker and means
there may be exceptions.

Another type of access that doesn't work with the VDUSE_DEV_SET_CONFIG
approach is reads that have side-effects. For example, imagine a field
containing an error code if the device encounters a problem unrelated to
a specific virtqueue request. Reading from this field resets the error
code to 0, saving the driver an extra configuration space write access
and possibly race conditions. It isn't possible to implement those
semantics suing VDUSE_DEV_SET_CONFIG. It's another corner case, but it
makes me think that the interface does not allow full VIRTIO semantics.

Yes. The VIRTIO spec has a generation count to handle multi-field
accesses so that consistency can be ensured:
https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.1/cs01/virtio-v1.1-cs01.html#x=
1-180004

I'm not aware of the details of why the current approach was necessary,
so I don't have any concrete suggestions. Sorry!
