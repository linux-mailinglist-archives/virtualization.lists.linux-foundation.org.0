*******************************************
HPDC 2024: Call for Workshops and Tutorials
Date: 3-7 June 2024
Location: Pisa, Italy
*******************************************

* Overview

HPDC warmly invites proposals for workshops and tutorials. Workshops offer
a platform for valuable discussions among researchers and practitioners,
focusing on key topics and emerging research areas in the field of
High-Performance Computing (HPC) and distributed computing. Workshops
typically feature a blend of invited talks, peer-reviewed papers, panel
discussions, and work-in-progress presentations. Workshop organizers are
encouraged to structure their sessions for an audience of approximately
20-40 participants, with flexibility for either a full day or half day
format depending on interest and space availability.

We welcome proposals for workshops on new, innovative topics as well as
submissions to continue successful workshops from previous years. Note that
proceedings of HPDC workshops will be published in by the ACM in dedicated
