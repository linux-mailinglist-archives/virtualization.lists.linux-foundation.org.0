Adding this field breaks old devices and drivers. Please make this field
conditional on the dgram socket type or the VIRTIO_VSOCK_F_DGRAM feature
bit.

Also, are all the other fields still used with dgram sockets? Maybe you
can use a union instead to reuse some space?

\field{dgram_tx_bytes} is not included in any struct definition?

Please use the VIRTIO specification terms "driver" and "device" instead
of VM and host.

It's not clear to me what "used" means. What exactly do the driver and
device need to do?

Does the device reject dgram packets or does the driver refuse to send
more dgram packets?

What does this mean? Does the timeout cause the device to drop packets
that haven't been handled yet (e.g. read by a host userspace process)?

POSIX Sockets have a receive socket buffer (rcvbuf) that is used for
memory accounting and dropping packets. Operating systems implementing
POSIX Sockets would use that to decide when incoming packets are
dropped. It seems like dgram_tx_byte does something similar at the
device level and I'm not sure why it's necessary?

In the POSIX Sockets model the virtio-vsock tx virtqueue is processed by
the device and packets are read into socket rcvbuf. They do not stay in
the virtqueue. This involves an extra data copy but it keeps the
virtqueue as empty as possible so that further communication is
possible.

"Then the packet will be dropped" is not clear to me. Is it saying the
device drops packets when buffer space has exceeded?

s/dropped/

Please stick to UDP semantics as much as possible so that applications
can be ported easily and developers aren't surprised by unexpected
behavior. UDP packets sent to a destination that has no listen socket
result in a Connection Refused error. vsock dgrams should behave in the
same way.

> +source port, the receiver can use them to send back a reply message.

The VIRTIO specification avoids using the word "may" (as well as "must"
and "should") outside the normative sections of the specification.

It's unclear what this sentence means: can the driver set the source cid
and source port to zero or an arbitary number if it does not need a
reply? (I guess the answer is "no" but the sentence implies setting the
source cid and source port is optional.)

> +

What does "a message is either sent or dropped" mean? Does it mean
messages are delivered once or not at all, but they are never
duplicated?
