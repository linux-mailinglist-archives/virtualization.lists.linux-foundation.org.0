Could you please provide some more details about the test system?
Is there anything important to make it reproducible?

The following aspects come to my mind. It might require:

   + more workers running on the same system
   + have a dedicated CPU for the worker
   + livepatching the function called by work->fn()
   + running the same work again and again
   + huge and overloaded system

My understanding is that you try to load the patch repeatedly but
it always fails after the 1 minute timeout. It means that it always
starts from the beginning (no livepatched process).

Is there any chance to try it with a longer timeout, for example, one
hour? It should increase the chance if there are more problematic kthreads.

If it is acceptable to wait hours or even days then the 1 minute
timeout is quite contra-productive. We actually do not use any timeout
at all in livepatches provided by SUSE.
