Yes.  And for that I need to know what VF it actually is dealing
with.  Which is tight integration in my book.

I really don't care about where the code lives (in the directory tree)
either.  But as you see with virtio trying to split it out into
an arbitrary module causes all kinds of pain.

Yes, anytjing exposing a vfio node needs vfio review, period.  And
I don't think where the code lived was the i915 problem.  The problem
was they they were the first open user of the mdev API, which was
just a badly deisgned hook for never published code at that time, and
they then shoehorned it into a weird hypervisor abstraction.  There's
no good way to succeed with that.
