Umm, that's basically what we have already? Architectures that use 
iommu_dma_ops select IOMMU_DMA.

The only issue is the oddity of x86 treating IOMMU drivers as part of 
its arch code, which has never come up against a cross-architecture 
driver until now. Hence the options of either maintaining that paradigm 
and having the 'x86 arch code' aspect of this driver "select IOMMU_DMA 
if x86" such that it works out equivalent to AMD_IOMMU, or a more 
involved cleanup to move that responsibility out of 
drivers/iommu/Kconfig entirely and have arch/x86/Kconfig do something 
like "select IOMMU_DMA if IOMMU_API", as Jean suggested up-thread.

In the specific context of IOMMU_DMA we're not talking about any kind of 
white-list, merely a one-off special case for one particular architecture.

Robin.
