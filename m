My implementation is for the purposes of opportunistic memory overcommit.
We always want to give balloon memory back to the guest rather than causing
an OOM, so we use DEFLATE_ON_OOM.
We leave the balloon at size 0 while monitoring memory statistics reported
on the stats queue. When we see there is an opportunity for significant
savings then we inflate the balloon to a desired size (possibly including
pressuring the page cache), and then immediately deflate back to size 0.
The host pages backing the guest pages are unbacked during the inflation
process, so the memory footprint of the guest is smaller after this
inflate/deflate cycle.

To be clear, the page cache can still be pressured. When the balloon driver
allocates memory and causes reclaim, some of that memory comes from the
balloon (bad) but some of that comes from the page cache (good).

Doesn't this suggest that the shrinker is preferable to the OOM notifier in
the case that we're actually OOMing (with DEFLATE_ON_OOM)?
