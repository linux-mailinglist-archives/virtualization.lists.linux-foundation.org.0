I think a private inteface would make more sense.  For now I've just
condensed it down to a generic set of quirk bits and dropped the
attrs structure, which seems like an ok middle ground for now.  That
being said I wonder why that quirk isn't simply set in the device
tree?

Fixed.  Can I get your signoff for the patch?  Then I'll switch it to
over to being attributed to you.
