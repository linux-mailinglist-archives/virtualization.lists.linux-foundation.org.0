Note that it is trivial for the host to DoS the guest.  All the host has
to do is stop responding to I/O requests (I2C or others), then the guest
will not be able to perform its intended functions, regardless of
whether this particular driver waits forever or not.  Even TDX (which
Greg mentioned) does not prevent that, see:

 https://lore.kernel.org/virtualization/?q=tdx+dos

Is that an Acked-by on this patch which does the latter?

If you mean that the spec should be changed to allow the virtio driver
to be able to program a certain timeout for I2C transactions in the
virtio device, yes, that does sound reasonable.
