Ok, I understood the problem. Well, I would say the nonatomic PCM mode
is more important option, since in this mode we can guarantee the
correct operation of the device. And if you say, that we need to get rid
of irq context here, then probably workqueue for calling
snd_pcm_period_elapsed() should be fine (of course, it should be shared
between all available substreams).

I quickly checked it. I think it's hardly possible to do anything here.
These functions to deal with vmalloced areas are not exported. And,
according to comments, require some proper locking on top of that. At
least, it does not look like a trivial things.
