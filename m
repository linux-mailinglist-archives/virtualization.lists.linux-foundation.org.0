Sent too early. So here's what I propose. Could you pls take a look
and if you like this, post a ccw section?
There's also an attempt to prevent fallback from modern to legacy
here since if driver does fallback then failing FEATURES_OK can't work
properly.
That's a separate issue, will be a separate patch when I post
this for consideration by the TC.
