Well, it's an example of how vDPA is implemented. I think we agree
that for vDPA, vendors have the flexibility to implement their
perferrable datapath.

That's fine. For nests, it's actually really easy, just adding an
interface within the existing transport should be sufficient.

I think not. Just to make sure we are on the same page, the proposal
here is for vDPA, and hope it can provide forward compatibility to
virtio. So in the context of vDPA, admin virtqueue is not a must.
