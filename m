Unfortunately that patchset in turn triggers kbuild warnings.
I was hoping you would address them, I don't think
merging that patchset before kbuild issues are addressed
is possible.

It also doesn't have lots of acks, I'm a bit apprehensive
of merging core changes like this through the vhost tree.
Try to CC more widely/ping people?
