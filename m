Ah, yes, can try to make that clearer.

Exactly.

Imagine you end up (only after some repeating plugging and unplugging of
memory, otherwise it's obviously impossible):

Memory block X: Contains only movable data

Memory block X + 1: Contains memmap of Memory block X:


We start to unplug from high, to low.

1. Try to unplug/offline/remove block X + 1: fails, because of the
   memmap
2. Try to unplug/offline/remove block X: succeeds.
3. Not all requested memory got unplugged. Sleep for 30 seconds.
4. Retry to unplug/offline/remove block X + 1: succeeds

What we do in 2, is that we trigger a retry of ourselves. That means,
that in 3. we don't actually sleep, but retry immediately.

This has been proven helpful in some of my tests, where you want to
unplug *a lot* of memory again, not just some parts.


Triggering a retry is fairly cheap. Assume you don't actually have to
perform any more unplugging. The workqueue wakes up, detects that
nothing is to do, and goes back to sleep.
