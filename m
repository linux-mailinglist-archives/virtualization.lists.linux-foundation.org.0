For the question of whether we need dgram_send_pkt_list, I tried to remove
it and that has no problem with virtio vsock in the guest. But on the host, we
still need to keep the dgram_send_pkt_list. The reason is that we cannot
access virtqueue memory reliably in the syscall handling of an
arbitrary process.
The virtqueue memory is in the QEMU process virtual memory and may be
paged out.
