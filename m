Great, send patches to fix them up instead of adding new infrastructure
to the kernel.  It is better to remove code than add it.  You can rip
the ISA code out of that driver and then you will not have the issue
anymore.

Or again, just add that module to the deny list and never load it from
userspace.

Of course, platform drivers are horrible abusers of this.  Just like the
recent one submitted by Intel that would bind to any machine it was
loaded on and did not actually do any hardware detection assuming that
it owned the platform:
	https://lore.kernel.org/r/20210924213157.3584061-2-david.e.box@linux.intel.com

So yes, some drivers are horrible, it is our job to catch that and fix
it.  If you don't want to load those drivers on your system, we have
userspace solutions for that (you can have allow/deny lists there.)

Like what?  What PCI drivers need outside connections to control the
hardware?

I agree, you can not "harden" anything here.  That is why I asked you to
use the existing process that explicitly moves the model to userspace
where a user can say "do I want this device to be controlled by the
kernel or not" which then allows you to pick and choose what drivers you
want to have in your system.

You need to trust devices, and not worry about trusting drivers as you
yourself admit :)

The kernel's trust model is that once we bind to them, we trust almost
all device types almost explicitly.  If you wish to change that model,
that's great, but it is a much larger discussion than this tiny patchset
would require.
