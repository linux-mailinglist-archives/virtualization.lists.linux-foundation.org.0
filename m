Yes. I checked his patch. And that helps.

I was thinking if we don't add two new virtqueues, then maybe we don't
need to add new feature bit too? If the other end does not support
dgram, then the packets will be just dropped. What do you think? Do
we still need to add dgram feature bits? I can have a feature bit for
mergeable buffer.

I see. I will add some limit to dgram packets. Also, when the virtqueues
are shared between stream and dgram, both of them need to grab a lock
before using the virtqueue, so one will not completely block another one.
