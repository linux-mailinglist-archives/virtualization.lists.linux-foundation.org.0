Oh I see.

Let's see what others say, it was just a doubt I had while looking at 
the patches.

Thanks for the clarification.

However looking better maybe it would make sense to add a new 
VHOST_BACKEND_F_* feature bit for this functionality since we are adding 
2 new ioctls to use together.

I saw that we used the VHOST_BACKEND_F_* only for the new IOTLB 
features, so maybe for this functionality the error returned by ioctl() 
could be enough. Let's see what others think.

Thanks,
Stefano
