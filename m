OK, thanks for point this out. Since the spec says so, I assume 
transitional is almost legacy.

However the spec also says:
Transitional Device a device supporting both drivers conforming to this 
specification, and allowing legacy drivers.

The transitional devices have their own device id, like 0x1000 indicates 
it is a network device.

Then why the sub-device-id has to be 0x1 in the spec? Is it because we 
have the driver first?

Thanks

If you are trying to build a device and want to create a safe way to

VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_VENDOR_CFG has been designed for things like this.
For example you can have:

So you will have to explain why the setup you are describing
makes any sense at all before we consider this a fix.

                <pre class="moz-quote-pre" wrap="">Other types of devices also have similar issues, like virito-blk.

I propose to fix this problem of modern-transitonal device
whith this solution, all in the modern code path:
1) assign the device id to mdev-&gt;id.device
2) add transitional device ids in the virtio-net(and others) probe table.

Comments are welcome!

Thanks!
