No problem, and thanks for following up.

Makes sense. The crosvm developers are also pretty friendly in my
experience, so I'm sure they wouldn't mind being involved in discussions
around any future ABI extensions. Just be aware that they _very_ recently
moved their mailing lists, so I think it lives here now:

https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/crosvm-dev

There was a similar suggestion from Stefano:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20220806105225.crkui6nw53kbm5ge@sgarzare-redhat

about spotting the backend ioctl for IOTLB and using that to enable
the negotiation of F_ACCESS_PLATFORM. Would that work for qemu?

Absolutely, I'm not seriously suggesting the revert. I just did it locally
to confirm the issue I was seeing.

If we can come up with something that we have confidence in and won't be a
pig to maintain, then I think we should do it, but otherwise we can go ahead
and change crosvm to mask out this feature flag on the vhost side for now.
We mainly wanted to raise the issue to illustrate that this flag continues
to attract problems in the hope that it might inform further usage and/or
spec work in this area.

In any case, I'm happy to test any kernel patches with our setup if you
want to give it a shot.

Documentation is a good idea regardless, so thanks for that. Even though
crosvm has its own bindings for the vhost ioctl()s, the documentation
can be reference or duplicated once it's available in the kernel headers.
