It should be used on any memory address that can throw exception on
load, which is any physical address, in paths that can tolerate
memcpy() returning an error code, most I/O paths, and can tolerate
slower copy performance on older platforms that do not support MC
recovery with fast string operations, to date that's only PMEM users.
