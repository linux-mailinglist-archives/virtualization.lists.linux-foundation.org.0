I agree that reusing kernel's workqueue code would be a good strategy.

One concern is how easy it is to implement an adaptive polling strategy 
using workqueues. From what I've seen, adding some polling of both 
backend and virtqueue helps to eliminate interrupts and reduce latency.

Anyway, I'll take a closer look at your patches next week. :-)

Thanks,
Stefano
