Ah, yes that topic again :)

I think we could relatively easily fix that by just defining and 
enforcing that the dma_resv_lock must have be taken by the caller when 
dma_buf_vmap() is called.

A two step approach should work:
1. Move the call to dma_resv_lock() into the dma_buf_vmap() function and 
remove all lock taking from the vmap callback implementations.
2. Move the call to dma_resv_lock() into the callers of dma_buf_vmap() 
and enforce that the function is called with the lock held.

It shouldn't be that hard to clean up. The last time I looked into it my 
main problem was that we didn't had any easy unit test for it.

Regards,
Christian.
