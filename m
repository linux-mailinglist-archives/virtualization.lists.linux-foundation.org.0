I don't understand what this means.  The whole entry mechanism on x86
is structured so that we call a C function *and return from that C
function without longjmp-like magic* with the sole exception of
unwind_stack_do_exit().  This means that you can match up enters and
exits, and that unwind_stack_do_exit() needs to unwind correctly.  In
the former case, it's normal C and we can use normal local variables.
In the latter case, we know exactly what state we're trying to restore
and we can restore it directly without any linked lists or similar.

What do you have in mind that requires a linked list?

Can you point me to exactly what code you're referring to?  I spent a
while digging through the code and macro tangle and I can't find this.

I will try to think of this, but it's hard, since I can't find the code :)

I found this comment:

 * With the current implementation it is always possible to switch to a safe
 * stack because #VC exceptions only happen at known places, like intercepted
 * instructions or accesses to MMIO areas/IO ports. They can also happen with
 * code instrumentation when the hypervisor intercepts #DB, but the critical
 * paths are forbidden to be instrumented, so #DB exceptions currently also
 * only happen in safe places.

Unless AMD is more magic than I realize, the MOV SS bug^Wfeature means
that #DB is *not* always called in safe places.

But I *thnk* the code you're talking about is this:

    /*
     * If the entry is from userspace, switch stacks and treat it as
     * a normal entry.
     */
    testb    $3, CS-ORIG_RAX(%rsp)
    jnz    .Lfrom_usermode_switch_stack_\@

which does not run on #VC from kernel code.

Eww.

True.  But is the rest of the machinery to be secure against EFLAGS.IF
violations and such in place yet?
