No, there should not be for PCI drivers.  If there is, that is a bug
that you can, and should, fix.

Not true at all, you can fix them, and write a simple coccinelle rule to
prevent them from ever coming back in.

No it is not.  It is "easier" for you because you all do not want to fix
up all of the drivers and want to add additional code complexity on top
of the current mess that we have and then you can claim that you have
"hardened" the drivers you care about.

Despite no one ever explaining exactly what "hardened" means to me.

Again, fix the existing drivers, you have the whole source, if this is
something that you all care about, it should not be hard to do.

Stop making excuses.
