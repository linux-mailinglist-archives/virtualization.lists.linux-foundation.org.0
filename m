It seems similar to use "wait_for_completion". If the other side is 
hacked, the guest may never

get the buffers returned by the host, right ?


For this moment, we can solve the problem by using a hardcoded big value 
or disabling the timeout.

Over the long term, I think the backend should provide that timeout 
value and guarantee that its processing

time should not exceed that value.
