The patch selects it (which makes sense given the small size).
The #ifdef is pointless then ...

That means no plans yet?

device memory == gpu-owned memory, typically exposed to as pci memory bar.

qemu stdvga for example stores gem objects in device memory (unless it
runs out of vram, then ttm allocates from / moves into main memory).

Tracking in __drm_gem_shmem_create + drm_gem_shmem_free_object should
give you pretty much the same results, with the major difference being
that it works for all shmem-based drivers.

Of course just moving the trace points doesn't solve the other issues
discussed.

Yep, maybe.  Which is *exactly* why Daniel keeps asking for the big
picture and how this integrates/interacts with the dma-buf accounting
which seems to be in the works too.

Note that dma-bufs are not only used for cross-device sharing.  They are
also used to pass handles from one application to another (application
to wayland compositor or x server for example).  Which doesn't matter
much for the totals, but for per-process accounting you need a plan how
to account these shared buffers.

I don't feel like merging patches with obvious shortcomings which have
a high chance to end up as technical dept.

The question how this interacts with dma-buf accounting must be
clarified.

I'd also suggest to join forces with the cgroups people.  The problem
space has alot of overlap.  Even if we end up with multiple ways to
export the accounting data the spots you have to hook into to actually
do the accounting should be largely identical.

take care,
  Gerd
