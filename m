Rethink of this, consider currently we do this via vendor stats, so
it's probably fine. Maybe we can have a better netlink API like
"vendor_queue_index" etc then everything should be fine.

Sure.

For virtqueue index (guest index) defined in the spec, I'd let
userspace to deduce it.

But for the host or vendor index, we probably can do this.

(Btw, I feel like we need to separate the features, if we agree to go
with host/vendor index, we can let guest index part in first).
