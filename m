Is there a particular reason to always have the event queue as the last 
one?

Maybe it's better to add the datagram queues at the bottom, so the first 
3 queues are always the same.

I'd say more like socket streams are supported, without reference to the 
feature bit, something like: "If no feature bits are defined, then 
assume device only supports stream socket type."

When Arseny's change will merged, we can define and use 
VIRTIO_VSOCK_TYPE_DGRAM,.

This sentence is a bit unclear.
`buf_alloc` for stream socket is used to inform the other peer about the 
receive buffer space. In this case we are using the local information, 
so there is no need to refer to `buf_alloc`. We can write something 
like: "The packet is dropped by the receiver if there is no space in the 
receive buffer".

Where does 1526 come from?

We're adding a requirement for socket streams that wasn't there until 
now.

I don't know if maybe it's better to break this patch in two, one where 
we add datagram and one for mergeable buffer.

But let's see what others think.
