Basically the second set is a subset of the first set.

I'm not sure I'm following you. Let me please qoute the specification:
"""
4. Read device feature bits, and write the subset of feature bits
understood by the OS and driver to the device. During this step the driver MAY read (but MUST NOT write) the device-specific configuration fields to check that it can support the device before accepting it. 
5. Set the FEATURES_OK status bit. The driver MUST NOT accept new feature bits after this step. 
"""

Are you suggesting that ->verify() should be after
virtio_finalize_features()? Wouldn't
that mean that verify() can't reject feature bits? But that is the whole
point of commit 82e89ea077b9 ("virtio-blk: Add validation for block size
in config space"). Do you think that the commit in question is
conceptually flawed? My understanding of the verify is, that it is supposed
to fence features and feature bits we can't support, e.g. because of
config space things, but I may be wrong.

The trouble is, feature bits are not negotiated one by one, but basically all
at once. I suppose, I did the next best thing to first negotiating VERSION_1.

I don't quite understand.

Anyway, how do you think we should solve this problem?
