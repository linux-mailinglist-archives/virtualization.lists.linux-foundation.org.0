Yea it's very useful - it's also useful for vdpa whether this patchset
goes in or not.  At some level, if vdpa can't keep up then maybe going
the vfio route is justified. I'm not sure why didn't anyone fix iommufd
yet - looks like a small amount of work. I'll see if I can address it
quickly because we already have virtio accelerators under vdpa and it
seems confusing to people to use vdpa for some and vfio for others, with
overlapping but slightly incompatible functionality.  I'll get back next
week, in either case. I am however genuinely curious whether all the new
functionality is actually useful for these legacy guests.

Something like the shadow vq thing will be more or less equivalent then?
That's upstream in qemu and needs no hardware support. Worth comparing
against.  Anyway, there's presumably actual hardware this was tested
with, so why guess? Just test and post numbers.
