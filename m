I reviewed the first part (af_vsock.c changes), tomorrow I'll review the 
rest. That part looks great to me, only found a few minor issues.

In the meantime, however, I'm getting a doubt, especially with regard to 
other transports besides virtio.

Should we hide the begin/end marker sending in the transport?

I mean, should the transport just provide a seqpacket_enqueue() 
callbacl?
Inside it then the transport will send the markers. This is because some 
transports might not need to send markers.

But thinking about it more, they could actually implement stubs for that 
calls, if they don't need to send markers.

So I think for now it's fine since it allows us to reuse a lot of code, 
unless someone has some objection.

Thanks,
Stefano
