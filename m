Right.

I tried to search for it earlier, but never found anything on virtio
list.  Maybe I missed it then.

Its okay, we are both trying to make things better here :)

I have sent a detailed review of your spec patch, lets do it there

It sounded strange yesterday to be honest, but I have gone past it
already :)

We (at Linaro) work on software enablement normally and not end
products (rarely that happen though), like framework level work in the
kernel which can later be used by everyone to build their drivers on.

There are many companies like Qualcomm, ST Micro, etc, who want to use
Virtio in general for Automotive or other applications / solution. The
purpose of Project Stratos [1], an initiative of Linaro, is working
towards developing hypervisor agnostic Virtio interfaces and
standards. The end products and applications will be worked on by the
members directly and we need to add basic minimum support, with all
the generally required APIs or interfaces.
