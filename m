As you mention below, the advantage of free page reporting is that it
doesn't trigger the OOM path. So I'd strongly advocate that the
corresponding mechanism to shrink page cache should also not trigger the
OOM path. That suggests something like the the drop_caches API we talked
about earlier in the thread.

Yes, I'm strongly in favor of your patch set's goals.

Right. My implementation can shrink the page cache to whatever size is
desired. It just takes a lot more (10x) time and CPU on guests using the
shrinker API because of this back and forth.

I agree that the desired behavior depends on the use case. But even for the
case that deflation is a last resort, it seems like we'd like to use the
shrinker API rather than the OOM notifier since the OOM notifier is more
likely to have bugs/errors. The shrinker API doesn't support this
functionality yet, but you could imagine configuring the API so that the
balloon is reclaimed from less frequently or only when shrinking other
sources is becoming difficult. That way we're not actually in the error
prone OOM path.

DEFLATE_ON_OOM necessarily causes deflate activity regardless of whether
the device wants to continue inflating the balloon. Blocking the deflate
activity would cause an OOM in the guest.

<br>
&gt; Two reasons I didn&#39;t go with the above implementation:<br>
&gt; 1. I need to support guests before Linux 4.19 which don&#39;t have the=
 shrinker<br>
&gt; behavior.<br>
&gt; 2. Memory in the balloon does not appear as &quot;available&quot; in /=
proc/meminfo even<br>
&gt; though it is freeable. This is confusing to users, but isn&#39;t a dea=
l breaker.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; If we added a DEFLATE_ON_PRESSURE feature bit that indicated shrinker =
API<br>
&gt; support then that would resolve reason=C2=A0#1 (ideally we would backp=
ort the bit to<br>
&gt; 4.19).<br>
<br>
We could declare lack of pagecache pressure with DEFLATE_ON_OOM a<br>
regression and backport the revert but not I think the new<br>
DEFLATE_ON_PRESSURE.<br></blockquote><div>To be clear, the page cache can s=
till be pressured. When the balloon driver allocates memory and causes recl=
aim, some of that memory comes from the balloon (bad) but some of that come=
s from the page cache (good).</div></div></div></blockquote><div><br></div>=
<div>I think the issue is that you aren&#39;t able to maintain the page cac=
he pressure</div></div></blockquote><div>Right. My implementation can shrin=
k the page cache to whatever size is desired. It just takes a lot more (10x=
) time and CPU=C2=A0on guests using the shrinker API because of this back a=
nd forth.</div><div>=C2=A0</div><blockquote class=3D"gmail_quote" style=3D"=

&gt; In any case, the shrinker=C2=A0behavior when pressuring page cache is =
more of an<br>
&gt; inefficiency than a bug. It&#39;s not clear to me that it necessitates=
 reverting.<br>
&gt; If there were/are reasons to be on the shrinker=C2=A0interface then I =
think those<br>
&gt; carry similar weight as the problem itself.<br>

&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I consider virtio-balloon to this very day a big ha=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0it getting better with new config knobs. Having tha=
t said, the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0technologies that are candidates to replace it (fre=
e page reporting,<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0taming the guest page cache, etc.) are still not re=
ady - so we&#39;ll have<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0to stick with it for now :( .<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; I&#39;m actually not sure how you would safely=
 do memory overcommit without<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; DEFLATE_ON_OOM. So I think it unlocks a huge u=
se case.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Using better suited technologies that are not ready=
 yet (well, some form<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0of free page reporting is available under IBM z alr=
eady but in a<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0proprietary form) ;) Anyhow, I remember that DEFLAT=
E_ON_OOM only makes<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0it less likely to crash your guest, but not that yo=
u are safe to squeeze<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0the last bit out of your guest VM.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Can you elaborate on the danger of DEFLATE_ON_OOM? I haven&#39;t seen =
any problems<br>
&gt; in testing but I&#39;d really like to know about the dangers.<br>
&gt; Is there a difference in safety between the OOM notifier callback and =
the<br>
&gt; shrinker API?<br>
<br>
It&#39;s not about dangers as such. It&#39;s just that when linux hits OOM<=
br>
all kind of error paths are being hit, latent bugs start triggering,<br>
latency goes up drastically.<br></blockquote><div>Doesn&#39;t this suggest =
that the shrinker is preferable to the OOM notifier in the case that we&#39=
;re actually OOMing (with DEFLATE_ON_OOM)?</div></div></div></blockquote><d=
iv><br></div><div>I think it all depends on the use case. For the use case =
you describe going to the shrinker might be preferable as you are wanting t=
o exert just a light bit of pressure to start some page cache reclaim. Howe=
ver if you are wanting to make the deflation a last resort sort of thing th=
en I would think the OOM would make more sense.</div></div></blockquote><di=
v>I agree that the desired behavior depends on the use case. But even for t=
he case that deflation is a last resort, it seems like we&#39;d like to use=
 the shrinker API rather than the OOM notifier since the OOM notifier is mo=
re likely to have bugs/errors. The shrinker API doesn&#39;t support this fu=
nctionality yet, but you could imagine configuring the API so that the ball=
oon is reclaimed from less frequently or only when shrinking other sources =
is becoming difficult. That way we&#39;re not actually in the error prone O=
OM path.</div><div><br></div><blockquote class=3D"gmail_quote" style=3D"mar=
