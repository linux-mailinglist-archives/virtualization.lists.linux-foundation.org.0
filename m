It's possible to do it like this, sure. But that's not the
only configuration, userspace needs to be smart about setting things up.
Which is my point really.

Same thing. NFS is pretty common, you are saying don't do it then. Fair
enough but again, arbitrary configs just aren't going to be secure.

Makes sense. Additionally, distros can tweak that to their heart's
content, selecting the functionality/security balance that makes sense
for them.

I am just saying don't do it then. Don't build drivers that distro does
not want to support into kernel. And don't load them when they are
modules.

Um. Tweaking driver code is not just build time, it's development time.
At least with kconfig you don't need to patch your kernel.
