Thanks for your constructive approach. I do want the hypervisor to
assume it gets GPA's. My train of thought was that the guys that need
to use IOVA's that are not GPA's when force_dma_unencrypted() will have
to to specify VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM (at the device) anyway, because
otherwise it won't work. But I see your point: in case of a
mis-configuration and provided the DMA API returns IOVA's one could end
up trying to touch wrong memory locations. But this should be similar to
what would happen if DMA ops are not used, and memory is not made accessible.

Unnecessary for powerpc because they do normal PCI. In the context of
CCW there are only guest physical addresses (CCW I/O has no concept of
IOMMU or IOVAs).

force_dma_unencrypted(&vdev->dev) is IMHO exactly about this.

In case of s390 this is given. I talked with the power people before
posting this, and they ensured me they can are willing to deal with
this. I was hoping to talk abut this with the AMD SEV people here (hence
the cc).

I don't get this point. The argument where the hypervisor is buggy is a
bit hard to follow for me. If hypervisor is buggy we have already lost
anyway most of the time, or?
 
> I don't see how this patch does this.

I do get your point. I don't know of a good way to check that DMA API
is giving us addresses that are actually physical addresses, and the
situation you describe definitely has some risk to it.

Let me comment on other ideas that came up. I would be very happy to go
with the best one. Thank you very much.
