Is that guaranteed though? I see nothing in VFIO checking *device* 
coherency, only that the *IOMMU* can impose it via this capability, 
which would form a very circular argument. We can no longer say that in 
practice nobody has a VFIO-capable IOMMU in front of non-coherent PCI, 
now that Rockchip RK3588 boards are about to start shipping (at best we 
can only say that they still won't have the SMMUs in the DT until I've 
finished ripping up the bus ops).

That's not an "if" - various Linux drivers *do* use no-snoop, which IIUC 
is the main reason for VFIO wanting to enforce this in the first place. 
For example, see the big fat comment in drm_arch_can_wc_memory() if 
you've forgotten the fun we had with AMD GPUs in the TX2 boxes back in 
the day ;)

This is what I was getting at in reply to v1, it's really not a "this is 
fine as things stand" kind of patch, it's a "this is the best we can do 
to be less wrong for expected usage, but still definitely not right". 
Admittedly I downplayed that a little in [2] by deliberately avoiding 
all mention of no-snoop, but only because that's such a horrific 
unsolvable mess it's hardly worth the pain of bringing up...

Cheers,
Robin.
