It is actually not possible.

Sorry, I don't particularly understand this passage.

Now, the question is if vring_use_dma_api() is false, then we cannot use DMA
API in AF_XDP.

The good news is that except for some of sync's operations, they are in the
control path. I think it is very small effect on performance. Because in most
case the sync is unnecessary.

Can we understand the purpose of this matter to back the DMA operation to the
driver? Although I don't know if there are other drivers with similar
requirements.

Thanks.
