Hi Stefano,

I checked the VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF feature bit and I think vsock
dgram can use that feature too.
Do we want to make this feature a must-have or optional? One idea is
to make it optional. When not
supported, dgram rx buf is 16 KB which should be good in most cases.
When VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF is supported, the rx buf is 4K and the max
packet size is 64 KB.

Also, just to make sure we are on the same page, the current vsock
stream code can also split a
big packet to multiple buffers and the receive side can assemble them
together.  But dgram cannot
use that code because the dgram may drop a buffer in the driver code
(if there is not enough space).
That means dgram may drop some buffers at the beginning, in the end or in the
middle of a pkt. And a packet may
not be received as a complete one. Therefore, we need something like
VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF.

If we want to leverage current stream code without using VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF,
we could add a total_len and offset to the virtio_vsock_hdr. Then when sending
packet, the device split the big packet to multiple small ones and
each has a header. They will have the
same total_len, but different offsets. On the driver side, the driver
can check the total_len before
enqueueing the big packet for the one with offset 0.
If there is enough space, all the remaining packets will be received.
If not, the remaining packets will be dropped.
I feel this implementation might be easier than using
VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF. But either one is fine with me.
Any preference? Thanks.

Regards,

Jiang
