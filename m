No, QEMU passes the raw messages to the backend daemon running in host
userspace (which shares a socket with qemu). The backend understands
the virtio/vhost protocols and so won't be required to change at all
if we move from Qemu to something else. And that's what we (Linaro)
are looking to do here with Project Stratos.

Create virtio based hypervisor agnostic backends.

Unfortunately, they aren't in good shape right now and the backend is
a bit hacky (Just checking the data paths, but not touching
/dev/gpiochipN at all for now).

I didn't implement one as I am going to implement the backend in Rust
and not Qemu. So it doesn't depend on Qemu at all.

To give you an idea of the whole thing, here is what we have done for
I2c for example, GPIO one will look very similar.

The Qemu patches:

https://yhbt.net/lore/all/cover.1617278395.git.viresh.kumar@linaro.org/T/

The stuff from tools/vhost-user-i2c/ directory (or patch 4/6) isn't
used anymore and the following Rust implementation replaces it:

https://github.com/vireshk/vhost-device/tree/master/src/i2c

I can share the GPIO code once I have the Rust implementation ready.

So I was actually looking to do some kind of aggregation on the host
side's backend daemon to share only a subset of GPIO pins, I will see
if that is something I can reuse. Thanks for sharing details.
