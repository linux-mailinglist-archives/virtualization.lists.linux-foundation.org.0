Yes.  The userspace driver should be able to internally mark the
resource as NO TRANSFER and omit it from execbuffer.  It can be tricky
though because resource wait will no longer work.

I can agree with that, although it depends on how much work needs to
happen in the userspace for virgl.

We will look into a userspace-only solution, or at least something not
involving uAPI additions.
