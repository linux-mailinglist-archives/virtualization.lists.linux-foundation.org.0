This patch doesn't eliminate vmexits. QEMU already has virtqueue polling
code that disables the vq notification (the virtio-pci hardware register
write that causes a vmexit).

However, when both the guest
driver and the emulated device are polling then there are no vmexits or
interrupt injections with this patch.

Software devices have cheap access to guest RAM for looking at the
virtqueue_disable_cb() state before injecting an irq. Hardware devices
need to perform a DMA transaction to read that state. They have to do
this every time they want to raise an irq because the guest driver may
have changed the value.

I'm not sure if the DMA overhead is acceptable. This problem is not
introduced by this patch, it's a VIRTIO spec design issue.

I was trying to express that dedicated polling queues would avoid the
DMA since the device knows that irqs are never needed for this virtqueue.

Nice, thank you for sharing the data!
