Right. I think originally it was "write features". We then added
the FEATURES_OK in order to give devices a chance to reject
a set of features, and while doing this we failed to
notice that at this point "acknowledge" became confusing.

There's a spec proposal to make things more explicit, and
I think I will tweak it to actually use the term
"acknowledge".

On top of that, it makes sense to go back, scan all of the spec
and see whether any places that we changed from set not negotiated
for clarify actually should read "set in the written".

not for writes, but for reads there's little choice.

right. at the moment it's just the MTU field. In the future it
can be more, but by that future time we can fix the spec ;)

I agree.
But I think I will start with figuring out the best name in the spec.
Maybe write back or acknowledge. Let's see what gets accepted by
the tc. Then I'll change code to match.

Yes but only for handling config reads. See my spec proposal.

for config space reads. yes.

that has to change, anyway - it's needed to fix endian-ness.

right. I think that can be a patch on top though.
