Either including the link that Michael shared or quoting the relevant
part verbatim in the commit message would help, thanks.

Thinking it over, my main concern is that the prescriptive section in
the spec does not state what to do when the value is clearly garbage,
as we have seen with syzkaller.

Having to sanitize input, by dropping if < ETH_HLEN or > length, to
me means that the device cannot trust the field, as the spec says it
should. 

Sanitization is harder in the kernel, because it has to support all
kinds of link layers, including variable length.

Perhaps that's a discussion for the spec rather than this commit. But
it's a point to clarify as we add support to the code.
