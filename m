I didn't remember that device_add() takes a reference to the parent, and
that device_del() before device_put(dev) and remove callback.

I tend to agree, my argument was based on the assumption that we did not
use to take a reference to the ccw device in virtio_ccw_online(), but we
do via register_virtio_device(). This reference however gets dropped
right before virtio_ccw_release_dev() is called.

I understand now. Let me think about it some more. I'm wonderning about
leafs. Will come back at you shortly.
