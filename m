I don't think that works in Makefiles. It would have to be ifdef.

Even better would be a separate CONFIG_SNET_VDPA_HWMON Kconfig option.

Per your own statement, that is not an error, and thus should not be logged
as one.

It would be much better to add a shim function in the include file.

There should be a dependency

	depends on HWMON || HWMON=n

in Kconfig, and the shim function would then be

#if IS_REACHABLE(CONFIG_HWMON)
void psnet_create_hwmon(struct pci_dev *pdev);
#else
void psnet_create_hwmon(struct pci_dev *pdev) {}
#endif

I referred to the other problems it reports, such as using macro arguments
without ().

That isn't the point. A 2-second hot loop is just as bad.
There should be a usleep_range() or similar between loop iterations.
