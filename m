This was v1. v1 was NAKd [1] [2]:

Allow for user override, just like we do today for new_id, remove_id,
bind, and unbind  when default driver policy is insufficient.

echo 1 > /sys/bus/$bus/devices/$device/authorized
echo $device > /sys/bus/$bus/drivers/$desired_driver/bind

The device filter is really only necessary to bootstrap until you can
run override policy scripts. The driver firewall approach was overkill
in that regard.
