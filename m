Makes sense.
Just a note, there are some VMMs, like Firecracker, Cloud Hypervisor, or 
QEMU with vhost-user-vsock, that don't use vhost-vsock in the host, but 
they implements an hybrid vsock over Unix Domain Socket:
https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/main/docs/vsock.md

So in that case this approach or netlink/devlink, would not work, but 
the application in the host can't use a vsock socket, so maybe isn't a 
problem.

Ah okay, thanks for the clarification!

I was worried because building with `make C=2` I had these warnings:

../drivers/vhost/vsock.c:944:13: warning: context imbalance in 'vsock_start' - wrong count at exit
../drivers/vhost/vsock.c:963:13: warning: context imbalance in 'vsock_stop' - unexpected unlock

Maybe we need to annotate the functions somehow.

Okay, I'll take a look and get back to you.
If it's too complicated, we can go ahead with this patch.

Thanks,
