Then you need to copy it out once, and then only deal with the local
copy.  Otherwise you have an incomplete snapshot.

That feels broken if you do not "trust" that other side.  And what
prevents the buffer from changing after you validated the other part?

For virtio, I thought you always implied that you did trust the other
side, when has that changed?  Where was that new security model for the
kernel discussed?

Are you sure this is even viable?  What is the threat model you are
attempting to add to the driver here?

Again, copy what you want out and then act on that.  If it can change
under you, and you do not trust it, then you have to work only on a
snapshot that you have verified.
