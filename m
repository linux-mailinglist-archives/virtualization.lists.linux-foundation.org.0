Not anymore. It was repurposed as a flags field very recently.

This use case is also very narrow in scope. And a very short path from
data producer to consumer. So I don't think it needs to claim scarce
bits in the skb.

tun_ebpf_select_queue stores the field, tun_put_user reads it and
converts it to the virtio_net_hdr in the descriptor.

tun_ebpf_select_queue is called from .ndo_select_queue.  Storing the
field in skb->cb is fragile, as in theory some code could overwrite
that between field between ndo_select_queue and
ndo_start_xmit/tun_net_xmit, from which point it is fully under tun
control again. But in practice, I don't believe anything does.

Alternatively an existing skb field that is used only on disjoint
datapaths, such as ingress-only, could be viable.

TUNSETSTEERINGEBPF was added to support more diverse queue selection
than the default in case of multiqueue tun. Not sure what the exact
use cases are.

But RSS is exactly the purpose of the flow dissector. It is used for
that purpose in the software variant RPS. The flow dissector
implements a superset of the RSS spec, and certainly computes a
four-tuple for TCP/IPv6. In the case of RPS, it is skipped if the NIC
has already computed a 4-tuple hash.

What it does not give is a type indication, such as
VIRTIO_NET_HASH_TYPE_TCPv6. I don't understand how this would be used.
In datapaths where the NIC has already computed the four-tuple hash
and stored it in skb->hash --the common case for servers--, That type
field is the only reason to have to compute again.

I don't understand. Toeplitz hash calculation is enabled by default
for multiqueue devices, and many devices will pass the toeplitz hash
along for free to avoid software flow dissection.

I understand the basics of RSS. My question is what the hash-type is
intended to be used for by the guest. It is part of the virtio spec,
so this point is somewhat moot: it has to be passed along with the
hash value now.

But it is not entirely moot. If most users are satisfied with knowing
whether a hash is L4 or not, we could add two new types
VIRTIO_NET_HASH_TYPE_L4 and VIRTIO_NET_HASH_TYPE_OTHER. And then pass
the existing skb->hash as is, likely computed by the NIC.
