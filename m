So:

virtio_vsock_vqs_init()
    virtio_device_ready()
    virtio_vsock_rx_fill() /* kick there */
rcu_assign_pointer(the_virtio_vsock, vsock)

It means at least virtio_vsock_rx_done()/virtio_vsock_workqueue needs
to survive. I don't say it has a bug but we do need to audit the code
in this case. The implication is: the virtqueue callback should be
written with no assumption that the driver has registered in the
subsystem. We don't or can't assume all drivers are written in this
way.

Unbind can trigger this path as well.
