I get what you are saying. However I don't know if it is acceptable
for the allocating thread to be put to sleep in this situation. There
are two scenarios where I can see this being problematic.

One is a setup where you put the page allocator to sleep and while it
is sleeping another thread is then freeing a page and your thread
cannot respond to that newly freed page and is stuck waiting on the
zeroed page.

The second issue is that users may want a different option of just
breaking up the request into smaller pages rather than waiting on the
page zeroing, or to do something else while waiting on the page. So
instead of sitting on the request and waiting it might make more sense
to return an error pointer like EAGAIN or EBUSY to indicate that there
is a page there, but it is momentarily tied up.
