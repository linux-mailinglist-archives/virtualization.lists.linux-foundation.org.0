Argh! Massive apologies, I've been totally overlooking that detail and 
forgetting that we ended up splitting out the dedicated 
enforce_cache_coherency op... I do need reminding sometimes :)

Interpreted in the *correct* context, I do think this is objectively 
less wrong than before. We can't guarantee that the underlying 
implementation will respect cacheable mappings, but it is true that we 
can do everything in our power to ask for them.
