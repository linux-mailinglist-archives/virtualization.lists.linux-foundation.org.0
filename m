Yes, it makes sense.

And yes, it must be unsigned!

Well, here we have no other choices, since we share the queue with
an interrupt handler.

The device provides 4 separate queues for communication with the driver,
and different data is transmitted over these queues:

The control queue (actually shared between all driver components) for
sending commands to the device. These requests must be synchronous. For
each request, the device must send a response, and we must wait for it.
What you can see in PCM ops are exactly sending these commands (set
params, prepare, start and so on). But since some ops could be called in
atomic context, there was no other choice but to add asynchronous
messages and return from the operator without waiting for a response
from the device. Because of this, the START command was a headache. We
could not say for sure if the substream started at all on the device
side. Also, the virtualization overhead was not taken into account
(application might think that the substream is already running, but
actually it was not).

Then there are 2 queues for sending/receiving PCM frames. These contain
i/o messages carrying actual buffer sliced into periods. Actually,
snd_pcm_period_elapsed() is called from interrupt handlers here.

And then there is an additional queue for events.

All of these are handled in different ways.
