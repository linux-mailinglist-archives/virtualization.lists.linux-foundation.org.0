Hello Anton,

thanks for the response. I added some inline comments.

Thank you, I got it. If I correctly understand you, after RELEASE is
issued, the specs specify only that the device should "return" all
buffers or "complete" them. Device implementations MAY or MAY NOT
playback them. In other words, the specification does not specify if
consumption should occur. I had interpreted this to mean that the guest
intended to output those buffers, leaving the device implementation with
no option but to do so.

Thanks for clarifying. Sorry to repeat myself, the point I want to make
is that the virtsnd_pcm_sync_stop() function that sends the RELEASE
control request uses virtsnd_ctl_msg_send_sync(). Message timeouts are
set up by the "msg_timeout_ms" module parameter. The timeout is the same
as for other control requests, such as SET_PARAM and PREPARE, but these
commands do not require flushing a queue, so I wondered how the timeout
could be the same.

I agree, thanks.
