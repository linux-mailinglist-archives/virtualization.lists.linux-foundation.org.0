There is no way the DMA API is going to promise that you.  All kinds
of platforms have offsets to DMA, and they are communicated through
interfaces like the device tree or ACPI.  But the good thing is that
your hypervisors is in control of that, neither the DMA API nor
virtio have any business to interfer with that.  In fact for harware
virtio device we might need such an offset for them to work on
lots of SOCs.
