Thanks for elaborating, now I think I get your point!

If I understand you correctly, what you would like is that GET_FEATURES 
should return only the data path features (thus exposed to the guest) 
and not the features for the VMM, right?

In that case, since we also negotiate backend features (with
SET|GET_BACKEND_FEATURES ioctls) for IOTLB messages to work, maybe we 
could only expose that feature if VHOST_BACKEND_F_IOTLB_MSG_V2 has been 
negotiated

@Michael, @Jason, do you think this could be doable?

I honestly don't know what the initial design was, though, from what
I've seen in QEMU, it only enables the known features, in fact for
example when we added F_SEQPACKET for vhost-vsock, we had to update QEMU
to pass the feature to the guest, so I think the initial idea was to not
unconditionally accept all the features exposed by the vhost device.

Maybe this part should be clarified.

Thanks,
Stefano
