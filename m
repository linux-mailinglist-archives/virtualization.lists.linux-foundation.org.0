My NACK still stands, as long as a few questions are open:

	1) The format used here will be the same as in the ACPI table? I
	   think the answer to this questions must be Yes, so this leads
	   to the real question:
	   
	2) Has the ACPI table format stabalized already? If and only if
	   the answer is Yes I will Ack these patches. We don't need to
	   wait until the ACPI table format is published in a
	   specification update, but at least some certainty that it
	   will not change in incompatible ways anymore is needed.

So what progress has been made with the ACPI table specification, is it
just a matter of time to get it approved or are there concerns?

Regards,

	Joerg
