This is in my to-review pile, along with a load of other stuff at the
moment:
	$ ~/bin/mdfrm -c ~/mail/todo/
	1709 messages in /home/gregkh/mail/todo/

So give me a chance.  There is no rush on my side for this given the
huge delays that have happened here on the authorship side many times in
the past :)

If you can review it, or anyone else, that is always most appreciated.

thanks,
