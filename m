Very much agreed.  It is one thing to add a patch to move do_exit
out of get_signal.  It is another to keep calling get_signal after
that.  Nothing tests that case, and so we get some weird behaviors.

I want to point out that we need to consider not just SIGKILL, but
SIGABRT that causes a coredump, as well as the process peforming
an ordinary exit(2).  All of which will cause get_signal to return
SIGKILL in this context.

I share most of these questions.

In a conversation long ago I remember hearing that vhost does not
support file descriptor passing.  Which means all of the file
descriptors should be in the same process.

Looking at the vhost code what I am seeing happening is that the
vhost_worker persists until vhost_dev_cleanup is called from
one of the vhost_???_release() functions.  The release functions
are only called after the last flush function completes.  See __fput
if you want to trace the details.


On one hand this all seems reasonable.  On the other hand I am not
seeing the code that prevents file descriptor passing.


It is probably not the worst thing in the world, but what this means
is now if you pass a copy of the vhost file descriptor to another
process the vhost_worker will persist, and thus the process will persist
until that copy of the file descriptor is closed.
