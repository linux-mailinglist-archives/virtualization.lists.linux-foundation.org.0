You're equating the mechanism with the architecture.  We use symbols
here to avoid module dependencies between kvm and vfio, but this is
just propagating data that userspace is specifically registering
between kvm and vfio.  vhost doesn't get to piggyback on that channel.

Only kvmgt requires the kvm pointer and the use case there is pretty
questionable, I wonder if it actually still exists now that we have the
DMA r/w interface through vfio.  Thanks,

Alex
