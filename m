How will this support the pretty common case where control vq
is programmed by the kernel through the PF, and others by the VFs?


I actually thought the way to support it is by exposing
something like an "inject buffers" API which sends data to a given VQ.
Maybe an ioctl, and maybe down the road uio ring can support batching
these ....
