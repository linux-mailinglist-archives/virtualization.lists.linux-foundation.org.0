I honestly don't know the reason for the name but 
VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM comes from the virtio specification:
   https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.2/cs01/virtio-v1.2-cs01.html#x1-6600006

   VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM(33)
      This feature indicates that the device can be used on a platform
      where device access to data in memory is limited and/or translated.
      E.g. this is the case if the device can be located behind an IOMMU
      that translates bus addresses from the device into physical
      addresses in memory, if the device can be limited to only access
      certain memory addresses or if special commands such as a cache
      flush can be needed to synchronise data in memory with the device.
      Whether accesses are actually limited or translated is described by
      platform-specific means. If this feature bit is set to 0, then the
      device has same access to memory addresses supplied to it as the
      driver has. In particular, the device will always use physical
      addresses matching addresses used by the driver (typically meaning
      physical addresses used by the CPU) and not translated further, and
      can access any address supplied to it by the driver. When clear,
      this overrides any platform-specific description of whether device
      access is limited or translated in any way, e.g. whether an IOMMU
      may be present.

IIUC the problem here is that the VMM does the translation and then for 
the device there is actually no need to translate, so this feature 
should not be negotiated by crosvm and vhost-vsock, but just between 
guest's driver and crosvm.

Perhaps the confusion is that we use VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM both 
between guest and VMM and between VMM and vhost device.

In fact, prior to commit e13a6915a03f ("vhost/vsock: add IOTLB API 
support"), vhost-vsock did not work when a VMM (e.g., QEMU) tried to 
negotiate translation with the device: 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1894101

The simplest solution is that crosvm doesn't negotiate 
VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM with the vhost-vsock device if it doesn't want 
to use translation and send messages to set it.

In fact before commit e13a6915a03f ("vhost/vsock: add IOTLB API 
support") this feature was not exposed by the vhost-vsock device, so it 
was never negotiated. Now crosvm is enabling a new feature (not masking 
guest-negotiated features) so I don't think it's a break in user space, 
if the user space enable it.

I tried to explain what I understood when I made the change, Michael and 
Jason surely can add more information.

Thanks,
Stefano
