That said, I can't resist the urge to say a few words to the responsible
senior and management people at Intel in this context:

I surely know that a lot of Intel people claim that their lack of
progress is _only_ because Thomas is hard to work with and Thomas wants
unreasonable changes to their code, which I could perceive as an abuse of
myself for the purpose of self-deception. TBH, I don't give a damn.

Let me ask a few questions instead:

  - Is it unreasonable to expect that argumentations are based on facts
    and proper analysis?

  - Is it unreasonable to expect a proper integration of a new feature?

  - Does it take unreasonable effort to do a proper design?

  - Is it unreasonable to ask that he necessary cleanups are done
    upfront?

If anyone of the responsible people at Intel thinks so, then they should
speak up now and tell me in public and into my face what's so
unreasonable about that.

Thanks,

	Thomas
