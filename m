Thanks for info on the use case!

All of these use cases either already use, or could use, huge pages
IMHO. It's not your ordinary proprietary gaming app :) This is where
pre-zeroing of huge pages could already help.

Just wondering, wouldn't it be possible to use tmpfs/hugetlbfs ...
creating a file and pre-zeroing it from another process, or am I missing
something important? At least for QEMU this should work AFAIK, where you
can just pass the file to be use using memory-backend-file.
