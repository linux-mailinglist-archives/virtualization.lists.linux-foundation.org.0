Yes. And the interface is horribly misnamed for that.  I'll see what
I can do to clean this up as I've noticed various other not very
nice things in that area.

This has been an explicit request from the amdgpu folks and thus been
on my TODO list for quite a while as well.  Note that I don't think it
should be a flag to dma_alloc_attrs, but rather for dma_alloc_pages
as the drivers that want non-snoop generally also want to actually
be able to deal with pages.
