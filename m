Hi Thomas.

Nice clean-up series - quite an effort to move one member to deprecated!

I have read through most of the patches. I left a few notes in my
replies but nothing buggy. Just nitpicks.

All above are:

I lost my confidence in my reading of this code.

I did not look at these at all. I hope someone else find time to do so.
