Hi guys,

I have one question about adding two new virtqueues for dgram. One new
thought is that we don't add two new virtqueues but keep using existing
virtqueues for both stream and dgram.

At the beginning when I first thought about supporting dgram, I thought
adding two new virtqueues would be easier and have better performance.
But now, after the prototype is done, I think that to keep using
existing virtqueues is also not complicated and could in fact be simpler.
The performance difference may not be very big.

Original code has about 3 places which have assumptions about the
virtqueues are only used by the stream. But we can change those codes.
One place is to check pkt len. We can check only for stream pkts.
Another two are in tx and rx code path where if queued replies pkts are
too much, the code will stop the rx queue and resume later. We can keep
that same logic. The dgram will be affected a little bit but that should
be fine I think. Are there any other places that we should fix?

In short, the virtqueues are in a lower level and can support multiple
flows and socket types. Use existing virtqueues also make it more
compatible with old versions.

What do you guys think? I remember Stefano mentioned that we should add
two new virtqueues for dgram. Stefano, do you have some specific reasons
for that? Could we just keep using existing virtqueues? Thanks.

Regards,

Jiang
