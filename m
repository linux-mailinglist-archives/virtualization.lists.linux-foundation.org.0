I think Arnd was primarily suggesting to reuse the IOMMU Device Tree
bindings, not necessarily the IOMMU drivers framework in Linux (although
that would be an added bonus.)

I know from previous discussions with you that making the grant table
fit in the existing IOMMU drivers model is difficult, but just reusing
the Device Tree bindings seems feasible?
