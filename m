Let me try to have a look at all the drivers to answer this.

1) A window between netdev_unregisger() and virtio_device_reset(), tx
callbacks may came and try to wake up the TX queue
2) refill_work can still be scheduled by the rx callback after
cancel_delayed_work_sync()

But this is how other drivers use to handle those races.

This sounds just like what you propose here or is it something other?
