Yep, agree. I wrote above that UA could be processed in a different
order. It was just another potential problem.

This last patch is not the solution.

I think the root cause is in the Linux driver and SCSI subsystem.
When the SCSI code receive an UA with REPORTED LUN CHANGED, it seems
it expects that `REPORT_LUNS` command is issued (I tried to describe it
in the first part).

The problem is that the SCSI stack does not send this command, so we
should do it in the driver. In fact we do it for
VIRTIO_SCSI_EVT_RESET_RESCAN (hotplug), but not for
VIRTIO_SCSI_EVT_RESET_REMOVED (hotunplug).

I think that's where the problem is, but I don't know if that's what the
specification expects, I haven't found much information on that :-(

I hope I covered in the previous answer.

Could be related on the race that you mention before (also without that
untested diff there should be the race)

Thank you very much for the suggestions!
I will try to ping the SCSI maintainers.

Yes, I can see that. We need to revert or somehow fix the device in
QEMU.
