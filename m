I tried to implement this function. One of the problems encountered is that we
need to save the dma address in virtnet for unmap. Especially in the case of
xmit, one skb may have multiple dma addresses.

1. Let virtio return the addr of each desc when detached.
2. Allocate a block of memory for each sq/rq to hold the dma address.

How do you think about this?
