My understanding is that, basically the driver should not trust the
device (since the driver doesn't know what kind of device that it
tries to drive)

1) For any read only metadata (required at the spec level) which is
mapped as coherent, driver should not depend on the metadata that is
stored in a place that could be wrote by the device. This is what this
series tries to achieve.
2) For other metadata that is produced by the device, need to make
sure there's no malicious device triggered behavior, this is somehow
similar to what vhost did. No DOS, loop, kernel bug and other stuffs.
3) swiotb is a must to enforce memory access isolation. (VDUSE or encrypted VM)

It looks to me if swiotlb is used, we don't need this since the
bouncing is not done at byte not page.

But if swiotlb is not used, we need to enforce this.

Similar to the above.

And the IOTLB page size.

It has an swiotlb, but the access and bouncing is done per byte.

Yes, swiotlb won't bounce the whole page. So I think it's safe.
