Any unprivileged user can check into this field to know parent device's capability without having to create a child vDPA device at all. The features that child vDPA device may support should be a subset of, or at most up to what the parent device offers. For e.g. the vdpa device dev1 you created below can expose less or equal device_features bit than 0x308820028 (MTU MAC CTRL_VQ CTRL_MAC_ADDR ANY_LAYOUT VERSION_1 ACCESS_PLATFORM), but shouldn't be no more than what the parent device can actually support.

Ok, Lingshan post an example here:

For e.g. for cpu flags, mgmt software can infer the guest cpus features in use from all qemu command line arguments and host cpu features/capability, which doesn't need to remember creation arguments and is easy to recover from failure without having to make the VM config persistent in data store. I thought it would be great if vdpa CLI design could offer the same.
