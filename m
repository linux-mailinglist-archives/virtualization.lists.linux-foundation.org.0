hmm, on CrOS I do see balloon getting used to balance host vs guest
memory.. but admittedly I've not yet looked closely at how that works,
and it does seem like we have some things that are not yet upstream
all over the place (not to mention crosvm vs qemu)

I guess with 4GB chromebooks running one or more VMs in addition to
lots of browser tabs in the host, it shouldn't be too hard to
demonstrate a problem ;-)

(but also, however we end up solving that, certainly shouldn't block
this series)

Userspace should know whether the BO has CPU storage, so I don't think
this should be a problem virtio_gpu needs to worry about

I think that, given virgl uses host storage, guest shrinker should be
still useful.. so I think continue with this series.

For host shrinker, I'll have to look more at when crosvm triggers
balloon inflation.  I could still go the MADV:WILLNEED_REPLACE
approach instead, which does have the advantage of host kernel not
relying on host userspace or vm having a chance to run in order to
release pages.  The downside (perhaps?) is it would be more specific
to virtgpu-native-context and less so to virgl or venus (but I guess
there doesn't currently exist a way for madvise to be useful for vk
drivers).
