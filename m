Yes, that would be cool!

For me a problematic use-case is multiple versions of the patchset.
So I have a tree and I apply a patchset, start testing etc. Meanwhile author
posts another version. At that point I want to know which version
did I apply. Since people put that within [] in the subject, it
gets stripped off.

Thinking about it some more, how about sticking a link to the *cover
letter* in the commit, instead?  That would serve an extra useful purpose of
being able to figure out which patches are part of the same patchset.
And maybe Change "Link:" to "Patchset:" or "Cover-letter:"?
