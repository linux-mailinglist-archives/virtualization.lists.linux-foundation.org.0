I don't use credit for DGRAM. But the dropping code I mentioned does not
rely on credit too. Just to make it clear, following is one part of code that
I referred to:

static bool virtio_transport_inc_rx_pkt(struct virtio_vsock_sock *vvs,
struct virtio_vsock_pkt *pkt)
{
if (vvs->rx_bytes + pkt->len > vvs->buf_alloc)
return false;

vvs->rx_bytes += pkt->len;
return true;
}

Sure. I think you mean you need to look at my final patches. I will
send it later.  Just a friendly reminder, if you just want to get some
idea of my patches, you could check this link :
https://github.com/Jiang1155/linux/commit/4e89736e0bce15496460ff411cb4694b143d1c3d

thanks. :)
